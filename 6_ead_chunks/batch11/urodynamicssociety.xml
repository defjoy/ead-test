         <abstract>U.S. organization, now known as the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU), founded in 1978, concerned with providing research and training in urology and urodynamics. Its founder was Saul Boyarsky, physician and faculty member at Duke University. Collection houses the records of the Urodynamics Society, now known as the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU), whose first president and founder was Dr. Saul Boyarsky, physician and faculty member at Duke University, and donor of the collection.  The bulk of the records chiefly consists of correspondence relating to the Society's activities and development chiefly during the 1980s. There are also several folders containing the Society's constitution and by-laws, written in 1978; printed articles and abstracts concerning urodynamics, Dr. Boyarski's business card, and other small items.  Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</abstract>
