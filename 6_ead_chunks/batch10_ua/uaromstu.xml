            <p>The Department of Romance Languages first appears in the Trinity College Bulletin in the 1903-1904 academic year.  The language of primary interest was French.  Before the development of the Department of Romance Languages there was an individual language department for French with Spanish being offered to seniors desiring an elementary understanding of the language.  Currently (2006) the title for the department is Department of Romance Studies and it offers a variety of comprehensive undergraduate programs-from beginning language courses to minors and majors-in French and Francophone Studies, Italian Studies, and Spanish and Latin American Studies. Portuguese is taught as a language program only.  The department also offers comprehensive PhD programs in French and Francophone Studies and in Spanish and Latin American Studies, as well as a Romance Studies PhD track that allows qualified graduate students to combine two Romance languages in their PhD studies.</p>

Languages present include English, French, and Spanish.  The materials in the collection range in date from 1903-1967, but the bulk of the material dates from 1923-1967.  </p>
