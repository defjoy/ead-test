         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>The Seashore Summer School developed out of an experimental summer school for teacher training that was started in 1919 by Holland Holton of Trinity College's Department of Education. The school, located at Oriental, North Carolina, initially operated as a branch of the college's summer school; another branch of the college's summer session was located at Lake Junaluska, NC.  Both braches became distinct corporations, the one in Oriental receiving its charter on February 5, 1924. William Preston Few, President of Trinity College was ex-officio the chairman of its board, and Taylor B. Attmore, Superintendent of Schools of Pamlico County, NC, its secretary, and later its director. As specified in the charter, it remained "affiliated with" Trinity and, later, Duke, and its offerings were included in the course catalogs of the college and university.  The school offered courses in education, history, music, and social and physical sciences. Courses had to be approved by North Carolina's Superintendent of Public Instruction.  Due probably to financial difficulties questions about its future began to come up late in 1927, and it appears to have ceased operations in 1928.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
