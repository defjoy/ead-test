         <p>Arthur Marcus Proctor was born on July 9, 1886, near Huntsville, Alabama. He received his
		  bachelor of arts degree from Trinity College (later Duke University) in 1910. He then attended the
		  Teachers College of Columbia University, where he received a master's degree in 1922 and a doctor
		  of philosophy degree in 1930.</p>
         
         
         <p>Before joining the faculty of Trinity College in 1923, Proctor served as the principal or
		  superintendent of several different school districts in Georgia and North Carolina. He also served
		  as Headmaster of Castle School on the Hudson in New York to complete his resident graduate
		  work.</p>
         
         
         <p>When he returned to Trinity College as Professor of Education, Proctor taught courses and
		  assisted in the Summer School program offered by the school. He worked closely with Professor
		  Holland Holton to train future educators for the growing public school system in North Carolina.
		  Proctor briefly served as Director of the Summer School and as Chairman of the Department of
		  Education. Proctor retired in 1952, and died on August 27, 1955.</p>
