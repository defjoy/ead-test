He participated in the Philippine Insurrection and the Moro Expedition before traveling to the Caribbean for the Cuban Pacification in 1906. During World War I, Brown was the 92nd Division Engineer in the American Expeditionary Forces. Throughout his career Brown developed river and harbor improvements in the United States.
