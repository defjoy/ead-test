         <abstract>Documentary photographer and instructor based in Petaluma, California; died in 1999. Collection features 167 black-and-white prints of documentary photographer Camhi's work on five projects: ADVantage, a series of portraits of individuals who have written personal want ads; Espejo and Farmworkers, which explore Mexican American labor activism and the lives of undocumented immigrants; Jews of Greece, portraits of Jewish people living in various places in Greece; and The Prison Experience, which documents inmates,their families, and staff of the California State Prison at Vacaville and their answers to the question Camhi posed to them about what they would like people to know about life in prisons.  The gelatin silver prints range in size from 8.5x13.5 to 10.25x13.25 inches; most are in 16x20 inch mats.  The collection of prints is accompanied by approximately five hundred original negatives and slides, many featuring Camhi's own family as well as several photographic projects not represented in the prints series.

He majored in English Literature at UCLA, then went on to a career in commercial photography; in the late 1960s he sold his business and began focusing on documentary work and teaching photography at San Francisco's City College.

               <p>Camhi directed this two-year visual exploration of Mexican American life and culture called <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Espejo,</title> and invited five other documentary photographers to join him.  The resulting body of work was exhibited in Chicago and Oakland and published in book form in 1978.  Primarily working in New Mexico and California, Camhi shot Mexican-American artists, sculptors, craftsmen and undocumented families at work and in their homes.  The prints measure from 7.75x12.25 to 11x14 inches, with most of them in 16x20 inch mats. Images taken by other project photographers are not included in this collection.</p>

               <p>Portraits of Jews, young and old, male and female, from various towns in Greece, taken by Camhi in the early 1980s.  Camhi himself was a descendant of Greek Sephardic Jews.  The images depict individuals at home and at work, usually accompanied by material possessions such as tools of their trade.  Prints range in size from 8.5x12.75 to 11x14 inches and most are housed in 16x20 mats.  The photographs were exhibited at Berkeley, California's Magnes Museum, and 80 images were published in book form in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Faces and Facets: The Jews of Greece,</title> (1992) which also contains two essays, one by Camhi and one on the historical context by Nikos Stavroulakis.

               <p>These portraits were taken over an 18-month period and feature inmates, families, and prison staff from the California State Prison at Vacaville.  Almost every image is accompanied by a statement, written on the frame, in answer to Camhi's question posed to his subjects: "What do you want people to know about the prison experience?" The images led to two traveling exhibits as well as a book.  Prints measure 11x14 inches and are all in 16x20 inch mats.  These photographs were published in book form as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Prison Experience</title> (1990).</p>

                  <p>Slides are both in sleeves and housed in small slide boxes.  The boxes include family photos, but also include images from Camhi's major projects - Farmworkers, Ad:Vantage, Roadside, The Prison Experience, and Espejo.  The sheets of slides also include these works, but also feature Haiku (one of his earliest projects), "Slavin," and Jews of Greece (JOG); titles are taken from slide labels or boxes.  Also includes an image of the artist Christo.</p>
