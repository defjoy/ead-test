         <p>William Kent Boyle (1840-1895) was a Methodist clergyman from Bladensburg, Maryland. He was licensed to preach and admitted on trial by the Baltimore Conference in 1860 and ordained as a deacon in 1862 and an elder in 1864. After serving several charges in Virginia and Maryland, he purchased the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Episcopal Methodist</title> in 1882 and edited this publication until his retirement. An obituary appears in the minutes of the Baltimore Conference for 1895.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Boyle Collection consists principally of sermons written mainly during the 1870s. Boyle was largely self-educated, and he appears to have been careful and diligent in preparing his sermons. Exegetical notes are attached to many of his drafts. Several of the sermons were written during the Civil War, but they contain no references to the war or slavery. Boyle's preaching remained expository rather than topical and was not concerned directly with the social issues of the day.</p>
         
         
         <p>A few items of correspondence and legal and financial papers are included in the collection, several of which indicate that one of his sons was involved in a court case. There are also undated copies of book reviews and testimonial letters praising a new hymn book.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
