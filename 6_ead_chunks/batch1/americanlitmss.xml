         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>In 1930 Professor Jay B. Hubbell proposed to the
		  American Literature Group of the Modern Language
		  Association of America that it should gather into an index
		  or catalog a record of the enormous amount of manuscript
		  materials in American literature so researchers and users
		  could readily locate the materials needed. Dr. Hubbell was
		  then asked to form a committee to formulate a plan. The
		  committee, made up of Professors Hubbell, Kenneth B.
		  Murdock, Ralph L. Rusk, and Robert Spiller contracted the
		  American Historical Association, which was planning a
		  similar program for history materials. The two groups
		  decided to join forces and compile a document relating to
		  manuscripts of American literature and to all phases of
		  American history. Funding problems caused this venture to
		  stalemate. </p>
         
         
         <p>The idea was kept alive, however, and in 1941
		  another committee chaired by Robert Spiller was formed and
		  instructed to gather information on materials of American
		  literary history. This committee prepared in essay form a 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Guide to Resources for
		  Research in American Literary History: A Preliminary
		  Survey</title> from data gathered informally--for the most
		part by personal interview and correspondence. The second
		World War caused plans for publication to be deferred.</p>
         
         
         <p> Using the material collected in the 1940s as a
		  basis for renewed efforts, a new committee chaired by Lewis
		  Leary was formed in 1950 to study the feasibility of
		  continued work, since much of the previous work had been
		  used in volume 3 of the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Literary History of the United
		  States</title>. The issue was discussed in a seminar, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">A Survey and Inventory of
		  American Literary Manuscripts,</title> at the 1950 meeting
		of MLA. The result was formal agreement on the need for
		some form of guide to manuscript resources. The seminar
		recommended formation of a committee on literary resources
		with Leary as chairman.</p>
         
         
         <p> In 1951 a working committee was appointed to
		  devise procedures and to commence gathering of data for
		  eventual publication of such a guide. This committee was
		  composed of Joseph Jones, chairman, University of Texas;
		  Ernest Marchand, San Diego State College; H. Dan Piper,
		  California Institute of Technology; J. Albert Robbins,
		  Indiana University; and Herman E. Spivey, University of
		  Tennessee.</p>
         
         
         <p>The purpose of this project was to provide for
		  scholars a helpful new aid in their perpetual search for
		  new material. The first edition published in 1960 indicates
		  the nature and scope of American literary manuscripts in
		  over 270 libraries pertaining to approximately 2,350
		  American writers. The specific primary purpose, as stated
		  in the preface of this publication, <emph render="doublequote">is to assist scholars, librarians, dealers,
		  and collectors in locating primary source materials
		  relating to American authors; to locate primary manuscript
		  sources with far greater use and accuracy than formerly; to
		  encourage collectors to deposit manuscripts where they
		  might be of greatest use and utility; and to encourage
		  librarians to think creatively about their collections and
		  to lend encouragement to manuscript departments.</emph>
         
         
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The project was begun by compiling an extensive
		  list of writers, publishers, and critics, and then
		  formulating eight categories distinguished by symbols that
		  would accurately record the extent and variety of
		  holdings--manuscripts, journals, letters by and to,
		  documents, etc. A checklist containing some 2,000 names of
		  American authors was then sent to American
		  libraries--academic, fraternal, historical, public,
		  etc.--with instructions as to how to apply and to list the
		  eight categories of holdings. After the holdings were
		  compiled on cards a preliminary draft was produced and
		  circulated for rechecking. The resulting master file of
		  reporting libraries formed the 1960 edition of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American Literary
		  Manuscripts.</title>
         
         
         </p>
         
         
         <p>With publication of this volume, the American
		  Literature Section of MLA authorized continuance of the
		  committee with J. Albert Robbins as chairman of the new
		  group. In 1969 it was felt that a revision and update were
		  needed. The American Literature Section of MLA again
		  sponsored the project with John Albert Robbins as chairman
		  of the editorial board, which consisted of Professors A.W.
		  Plumstead, University of Massachusetts; Joseph V. Ridgely,
		  Columbia University; Kimball King, University of North
		  Carolina, Chapel Hill; F. Warren Roberts, University of
		  Texas; George Hendrick, University of Illinois; Edward P.
		  Nolan, University of Colorado; and John Stafford, San
		  Fernando Valley State College.</p>
         
         
         <p>The 1960 list of authors was retained as a base
		  and expanded to include 2,750 authors, publishers, and
		  critics whose names were to be checked for locations and
		  holdings of manuscripts and other papers. The United States
		  was divided into first seven, then later, eight regions,
		  with each member of the editorial board acting as a
		  regional chairman. Each regional chairman then chose
		  regional associates within his region to solicit and
		  coordinate the holdings of the area assigned to him. During
		  the first year J. V. Ridgely and John Stafford resigned.
		  The Middle Atlantic region was divided into two regions and
		  Professors Alan Margolies of John Jay College of Criminal
		  Justice, CUNY, and Leo Weigant of the University of
		  Maryland were chosen to replace J. V. Ridgely. Professor
		  Thomas Wortham, University of California, Los Angeles,
		  replaced John Stafford in the Pacific Coast area.
		  Sixty-three regional associates were chosen.</p>
         
         
         <p> The 1960 edition of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American Literary
		  Manuscripts</title> was put on computer tape and print-outs
		of the holdings reported by individual libraries were
		distributed by the regional chairmen for rechecking,
		updating, and revision along with instructions for listing
		new additions and new authors. A completely new list could
		be compiled if the library so desired. When all the
		participating libraries and depositories completed their
		listings they sent the compilations to the regional
		associates who, in turn, sent them to the regional
		chairmen. They edited the lists before sending them to
		Professor Robbins, who did the overall editing and
		transferring of the findings to computer tape. Print-outs
		were again sent to the libraries for verification,
		correction, and updating to 1975. When these were returned
		and all corrections and additions were listed, the data was
		inverted to provide an alphabetical list by author and the
		master tape was sent to the publisher for machine-set
		composition. The volume was printed from the computer tapes
		by the University of Georgia Press in 1977.</p>

         <p>The 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American Literary
		  Manuscripts</title> Records (accession #5-6-81) (8,098
		items, 10.8 lf; dated 1930-1979) documents the process by
		which the guide was created. It contains the correspondence
		of J. A. Robbins with each of his editors for each region
		of the United States (the Regional Chairmen), copies of the
		directives sent to participating libraries, copies of the
		master list of names to be checked, minutes of editorial
		board meetings, descriptions of the project, a proposal for
		a computerized updating of the census of library holdings
		of American literary manuscripts, negotiations with the
		publisher, grant requests, and reports. The correspondence
		between Midwest Regional Chairman, George Hendrick, and his
		Regional Associates is included in order to demonstrate how
		the project operated. The questionnaires returned by the
		libraries in that region are included. There are also ten
		printouts, included as a random sampling of printouts
		required. Acquired as part of the Jay B. Hubbell Center for
		American Literary Historiography. </p>

		  dated 1962-1981) contains correspondence, background
		  material, page proofs, post-publication additions and
		  corrections, and publicity relating primarily to the 2nd
		  edition of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American Literary
		  Manuscripts</title> published in 1977. It updates the
