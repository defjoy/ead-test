         <abstract>Writer, critic, translator, and faculty member at Duke University specializing in modern French literature. The Wallace Fowlie Papers span the years 1936 to 1998 and consist mainly of correspondence sent to Fowlie, but also publications on French literature authored by Fowlie, typescript and handwritten drafts by Fowlie, amd clippings pertaining to Fowlie's career. A significant portion of the correspondence comprises exchanges between Fowlie and Thomas and Kit Foster. These letters mainly address personal and family matters (health issues, vacations and meeting with mutual friends), but also cover projects Fowlie was working on, teaching positions accepted and rejected and class progress, and other matters of professional relevance. There is also a folder of correspondence with Fowlie, almost entirely in French, that was maintained by John M. Dunaway, a Romance Languages professor at Mercer College in Georgia. It includes a few color photographs. Other smaller amounts of correspondence come from Robert Heslen, a former student of Fowlie, and well-known writers/artists including René Char, Jean Cocteau, André Gide, Alexis Léger (Saint-Jean Perse), Marianne Moore, Anaïs Nin, and others, discussing literary matters and their writings and careers. A folder of general correspondence contains single letters from a variety of colleagues and friends.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Wallace Fowlie Papers span the years 1936 to 1998 and consist mainly of correspondence sent to Fowlie, but also publications authored by Fowlie, typescript and handwritten drafts by Fowlie, newspaper and newsletter article clippings pertaining to Fowlie, and other assorted printed material. A significant portion of the correspondence comprises exchanges with Fowlie and Thomas and Kit Foster, close friends of Fowlie. These letters mainly address personal and family matters (health issues, vacations and meetings with mutual friends), but also cover projects Fowlie was working on, teaching positions accepted and rejected, and class progress, and other matters of professional relevance. There is also a folder of correspondence with Fowlie, almost entirely in French, that was maintained by John M. Dunaway, a Romance Languages professor at Mercer College in Georgia. It includes a few color photographs. Other smaller amounts of correspondence, much of which is in French, come from Robert Heslen, a former student of Fowlie, and well-known writers, artists, and poets including René Char, Jean Cocteau, André Gide, Alexis Léger (Saint-Jean Perse), Marianne Moore, Anaïs Nin, and others, discussing French literature, their writings and careers, and Fowlie's writings. A folder of general correspondence contains single letters from a variety of colleagues and friends.</p>

               <p>Chiefly consists of exchanges between Wallace Fowlie and well-known writers and friends. With the exception of the Foster and Heslen correspondence, which contains letters from Fowlie, the bulk of the items are from correspondents writing to Fowlie. Substantial groups of correpondence from individuals have been foldered separately. Smaller amounts of one to four letters are housed in General Correspondence; correspondents include Alain Bosquet, Kenneth Burke, René Char, Edouard Dermit (the adopted son of Jean Cocteau), André Gide, Marianne Moore, Jean Renard, and others. Arranged in chronological order within folders, with the exception of General Correspondence, which is alphabetical by last name.</p>
