         <p>Jim Friedman is the current William Rand Kenan, Jr. Professor of Economics emeritus at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. He was born in 1936 in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned his B.A. in Economics from the University of Michigan in 1959. He then went to Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D. in Economics in 1963. His dissertation was titled <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Theory of Oligopoly.</title>
         
         
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Following graduation, he was an assistant professor and researcher at the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics at Yale. In 1968, he moved to the University of Rochester, where he eventually became chair of the Economics Department in 1975. He taught for a short period at Virginia Tech before joining the Economics Department at UNC in 1985.</p>
         
         
         <p>Friedman's research interests in economics included oligopoly, duopoly, game theory, and noncooperative equilibria. Some of his books include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Oligopoly and the Theory of Games</title> (1977), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Research in Experimental Economics: An Experiment with Noncooperative Oligopoly</title> (1979, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Oligopoly Theory</title> (1983), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Game Theory with an Application to Economics</title> (1986), and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Problems of Coordination in Economic Activity</title> (1994).</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
