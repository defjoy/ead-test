                  <p>Beginning with the words 'Mon Cher Monsieur' (My Dear Sir), it is written by someone named Pindardi and is addressed to a Mr. Dugas (Merchant) in Augusta.  This is probably a reference to the city in Georgia, as Savannah is also mentioned. The letter appears to be sent from Clarksville.</p>

                  <p>This item appears to be a to-do list for someone going to St. Maler.  The document consists of notes on the verso and eight points on the recto which concern a family named Dedieu (Louis Dedieu in particular) making reference to several things such as baptism, parental rights, and verifying whether the Louis Dedieu in question is the same one who made a fortune in St. Dominique.   </p>
