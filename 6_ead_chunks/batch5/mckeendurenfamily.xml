         <abstract>Two related families of ministers and educators living in New England and the Midwestern United States. The McKeen-Duren Family Papers span the dates 1720-1945, with the bulk of the material covering the period between 1855 and 1900. The papers are arranged into the following series: Correspondence, the largest series; Diaries and Scrapbooks; Financial Papers; Genealogy; Legal Papers; Photographs; Printed Materials; Writings; and Oversize Material. The Writings series is divided into two subseries, Manuscripts and Volumes. There are many boxes of correspondence spanning the years 1816-1934, with a large section dating from the Civil War. The Photographs Series is also large and offers many fine examples of 19th century photographic processes, including ambrotypes, cyanotypes, daguerreotypes, tintypes, albumen prints, cartes de visite, and early gelatin silver or platinum prints. As a whole, the collection serves as a rich source of detail on the debates on statehood and the abolition of slavery, the Civil War, religion in New England, literary and educational traditions in the 19th century United States, 19th century New England society, and the history of the McKeen-Duren families from the 1700s to the 20th century.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The McKeen-Duren Family Papers span the dates 1720-1945, with dates on the majority of the items falling between 1855 and 1900. The materials in the collection document in great detail the histories of the members of these two New England families of educators, ministers, writers, and abolitionists, with the focus primarily on the McKeens. The papers are arranged into the following series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, the largest series; <emph render="bold">Diaries and Scrapbooks</emph>; <emph render="bold">Financial Papers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Genealogy</emph>; <emph render="bold">Legal Papers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>; <emph render="bold">Printed Materials</emph>, which includes clippings and ephemera; <emph render="bold">Writings</emph>, divided into volumes and manuscripts; and finally, there is a small group of <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph>. The photographs series is large and offers many fine examples of 19th century photographic processes, including ambrotypes, cabinet cards, cyanotypes, daguerreotypes, tintypes, albumen prints large and small, cartes de visite, postcards, and early gelatin silver printing-out images or platinum prints. Most are individual portraits but there are also interiors of family rooms and images of educational institutions. Topics of note documented across all the series include religious thought and institutions in New England, the education of women and the careers of female educators, photography in the 19th century, the Civil War and its effects on New England society, westward migration patterns, social life in Massachusetts and Vermont, family relations in the 19th century, 19th century New England women writers and their activities; and New England genealogy. There are also many clippings in the scrapbooks debating the abolition of slavery, many written by Silas McKeen. As a whole, the collection serves as a rich source of detail on 19th century New England social life and customs, and the history of the McKeen and Duren families from the 1700s to the 20th century. </p>
         
         
         <p>The bulk of the manuscript material is housed in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Correspondence Series</ref>, which chiefly consists of exchanges between members of the McKeen-Duren families. The earliest correspondence originates from New England, the McKeen family having been established in the area by brothers James, William, and Samuel McKeen, who emigrated to America from Ireland in the early 18th century. Beginning around 1823, letters exchanged between Silas McKeen and the father of Serena McKeen, who married Charles Duren, become more numerous. A significant portion of the correspondence was written by Silas to his son Charles, who served as a Union soldier during the Civil War. The family's exchanges then began to stretch westward during a period in which Philena and Phebe McKeen taught at the Western Female Seminary, Oxford, Ohio, and when Charles McKeen Duren moved to Iowa following the Civil War. Prominent topics in the letters from the latter half of the 19th century include Phebe and Philena's literary and publishing activities; education in New England and the Midwest; the Civil War and its effect on New England citizens; and routine family topics such as health, religion and morality, and social activities. There are very probably references to the abolition movement and slavery - the McKeens, Silas in particular, were outspoken abolitionists.</p>
         
         
         <p>The family's penchant for a rich variety of written communication is also reflected in the numerous pieces in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s8" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Writings Series</ref>, which is divided into two subseries, Manuscripts and Volumes. The Manuscripts subseries contains handwritten copies of a variety of types of writing done by members of the McKeen-Duren family arranged in rough chronological order. The Volumes subseries contains often unattributed handwritten drafts and notes on fictional pieces; essays, probably written by Phebe or Philena; and sermons, most likely written by Silas McKeen. There may be material related to Silas McKeen's writings on slavery.</p>
         
         
         <p>The collection is especially notable for its extensive <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Photographs Series</ref>. Almost all photographic media common to the 19th century can be found here, including many albumen prints, chiefly in the form of cartes-de-visite and cabinet cards; cyanotypes; and cased and uncased ambrotypes, daguerreotypes and tintypes. Also present are gelatin silver printing-out images or possibly platinum prints. The series is divided into four subseries: Albums, Cased Images, Oversize Prints, and Prints. A few of the albums originated from family trips to England and the Middle East. One family member, perhaps Phebe, was reportedly an avid amateur photographer, but direct evidence of this remains to be discovered. Interior photographs of the family's home show multitudes of photographs hung on the wall. Other subjects include family members from babyhood to old age, family friends, travel in England and the Middle East, pets, and horses. There are few landscapes but there is a sequence of images taken at Abbott Academy of buildings, grounds, and students with their teachers. Some of the photographic items, particularly the cased images, are fragile and should be handled with care.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Diaries and Scrapbooks Series</ref> contains many personal journals and diaries, spanning the years 1804-1900, and scrapbooks, circa 1838-1902.  The diaries are quite detailed and were chiefly written by the female members in the McKeen family; topics revolve around family health problems, visitors and travel, readings, the weather, and emotional or religious experiences. There may be passing references to slavery; there is one reference to a prominent abolitionist, later imprisoned, who visited the McKeen house. The scrapbooks house pasted-in clippings pertaining to family members, and many published short pieces written by Silas, Phebe, and Philena McKeen. There are also handwritten extracts of letters, as well as prescriptive pieces and poems, and a series of pages from Civil War periodicals. There are quite a few clippings in the scrapbooks on slavery and abolitionism, as well as references to issues pertaining to statehood; many of the anti-slavery pieces published in New England serials were written by Silas McKeen from the 1830s to the 1850s. The clippings folder in the Printed Material Series contains similar loose items.</p>

               <p>This series starts off with a single folder of birthday "Certificates," letters written from Silas McKeen, Charles Duren, and Charles McKeen Duren to their children giving thanks and a description of the child on the occasion of his or her birthday. A significant portion of the correspondence falls during the United States Civil War period, 1861-1865 (17 folders); they were written mainly by Silas McKeen to his son Charles, who served in the Union Army. Exchanges from this period express the senders' thoughts on contemporary events and are sometimes written on stationery supporting the Union cause, and include passing references to slavery. A number of letters pertain to or are written by Freeman Duren, a family member who served in the 13th Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteers. There are very probably many more references to the abolition movement and slavery in the correspondence - the McKeens, Silas in particular, were abolitionists. Following the Civil War, the bulk of the correspondence generally belongs to members of the Duren family in Iowa, and refer to family matters, health and sickness, honors received by family members, and business. Themes of note include the teaching and education administration career of Philena McKeen, who was Principal of Abbot Academy, Andover, Massachusetts for 33 years (1859-1892). The literary career of Phebe McKeen, sister of Philena and a teacher at Abbot Academy, is also a notable topic of correspondences in the collection. From 1859 a number of the exchanges relate to Phebe's contributions to serial publications and several book-length works: <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic"> Thornton Hall</title> (1872), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic"> Theodora</title> (1875, entitled <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Theodora Cameron</title> when published in the United Kingdom circa 1878), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Little Mother and her Christmas</title> (1876), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Annals of Fifty Years: A History of Abbot Academy, Andover, Mass., 1829-1879</title> (1880, coauthored with her sister, Philena), and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sketch of the Early Life of Joseph Hardy Neesima</title> (1890, published posthumously). A letter of particular note sent to Philena McKeen in March of 1892 is from the widow of Joseph Hardy Neesima, the first Japanese person to receive a degree from a western college, Amherst College, and founder of what would become Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan; in it she thanks Philena for sending a copy of the book that Phebe McKeen had written about Joseph Hardy Neesima. Another letter of note comes from Harriet Beecher Stowe (1892 May 5), sent along with an autographed copy of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</title> for a new library/reading room that was constructed at Abbot Academy. Two letters, the first from an unidentified writer addressed to Miss McKeen (1890 Nov. 3) and the second from the widow of Joseph Hardy Neesima include cartes-de-visite photographs. </p>

The diaries and journals, described more fully below, were kept by various individuals in the McKeen family, mostly women, and span the years from 1804-1898; most are quite detailed. The scrapbooks house many clippings pertaining to family deaths or honors, publications written by family members, and other events relating to the McKeen-Duren families. In the scrapbooks probably kept by Silas McKeen from the 1830s through the 1850s, there are a number of clippings regarding abolitionism, slavery, and various political events relating to statehood, the Dred Scott Decision, and other national issues preceding the Civil War. Arranged in chronological order.</p>

Diary, 1851-1854, begins on page marked "29," entries written by a woman, possibly Serena, George's sister, as it mentions Philena and Phebe in the third person. Postscript from 1853 may be by a different hand, as it speaks of "our dear" Serena's illness after June 1851. Comments on page 40 that antislavery "martyr" Capt. [W?alker], came to dine; had been imprisoned and was evidently supported by the McKeens.</p>

There are lists of addresses on the last few pages. The 1864 almanac's memoranda, which chiefly record Silas' travels, are even more brief.</p>

                     <p>A large scrapbook contains a lengthy series of published exchanges from 1838-1840 on slavery, apparently initiated by Silas McKeen, addressing church members in Mississippi. In the same scrapbook there are many published extracts from <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Christian Banner</title> written under the pseudonym Jenny Bradford, most likely Philena McKeen. Some travel pieces are signed by Philena, and clearly pertain to travels which are also documented in her diaries in this collection. Many of the writings by Bradford also appear in a Civil War-era newsletter published by the Tract Society of Boston, and these pages are pasted into the same scrapbook. A second large scrapbook, from the 1860s and 1870s, contains a handwritten chronology of military and civil events during the Civil War, and a handwritten transcription of President Lincoln's last inaugural address, March 4, 1865. Other scrapbooks also contain clippings on slavery, the Dred Scott Decision, and events concerning statehood and slavery, as well as many poems, prescriptive anecdotes, temperance pieces, and other writings by the McKeen family and other authors. One scrapbook contains a pasted-in confederate bill for ten cents, issued in Charleston, S.C. in 1861. The latest date in these scrapbooks appears to be 1902.</p>

               <p>The Writings Series is divided into two subseries, Manuscripts and Volumes. Manuscript folders of this series (10 folders) contain handwritten copies of short stories and essays, manuscripts, burial services, sermons, speeches, reports, themes for pedagogical purposes, in rough chronological order ranging from 1816 to 1899, with two folders of undated materials. Volumes in the series (5 volumes in 4 folders) contain unattributed handwritten drafts and notes on fictional pieces, essays or texts, most likely written by Phebe. The author of the manuscript sermons is most probably Silas. There may be material in this series related to Silas' anti-slavery writings published in book form and in periodicals prior to the Civil War.</p>
