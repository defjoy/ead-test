		  all from Duke University. He served for 10 years as chief
		  scientific adviser to the Army Research Office advisory
		  council. In addition to other honors, Hobbs received the
		  U.S. Dept. of Army's Outstanding Civilian Service Medal in
		  1959 for his contribution to the establishment of the Army
		  Research Office.</p>
         
         
         <p>Hobbs participated in professional organizations

		  service award in his honor. Hobbs also received the
		  University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service at
		  Duke in 1989.</p>
