         <p>Born Feb. 5, 1896, in Brockton, Mass., Nelson was
		  educated at Clark University (A.B., 1916; A.M., 1921) and
		  Cornell University (Ph.D, 1925). He was an assistant in
		  Medieval History at Cornell (1922-1923), assistant
		  professor at the University of South Dakota (1923-1925),
		  professor of Medieval History at Cornell University
		  (1926),and assistant curator of the President White
		  Historical Library. In 1926, he came to Duke University and
		  stayed until his retirement in 1965.</p>
         
         
         <p>Nelson received a number of awards and grants. He
		  was named an Andrew D. White Fellow in European History
		  (1921-1922) and studied at the Sorbonne, Ecole de Droit,
		  Ecole des Hautes Etudes, and the University of Cologne. He
		  also received an American Council of Learned Societies
		  Grant (1930-1931) and spent the year in Italy. Nelson was a
		  member of the Medieval Academy of America, the American
		  Historical Association, and the Phi Kappa Phi scholarship
		  society. </p>
         
         
         <p>Nelson's special interests in research and
		  teaching were Renaissance civilization, the history of
		  liberty and ideas of tolerance, heresy and persecution,
		  church and state relations, italian origins of modern
		  diplomacy, and balance-of-power relationships.</p>
         
         
         <p>Nelson married in 1927 and had four children.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Ernest W. Nelson Records and Papers is divided
		  into three series:
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Subject Files</ref>, the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Chamber Arts Society</ref>, and
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Personal and Family
			 Materials</ref>. The collection includes correspondence,
		  financial records, lectures, reports, student papers, and
		  other printed material.</p>
         
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Subject Files</ref> Series,
		  1926-1973, is mainly concerned with the internal
		  functioning of the university, the history department,
		  cultural life on campus, and faculty organizations. A
		  number of student folders are filed in this section, under
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">History Dept.:
		  Students.</title> Nelson selected these particular folders
		to give examples of his grading system, to show some of his
		students' work, and to cover the span of Nelson's years at
		Duke. The folders of those students who achieved prominence
		are also included in this section.</p>
         
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Chamber Arts Society</ref> Series,
		  1945-1975, contains financial records, membership lists,
		  programs, and correspondence. Nelson founded the Durham
		  Chamber Arts Society in 1945 to offer members of the Durham
		  and Duke communities an opportunity to further their
		  appreciation of the fine arts. The Chamber Arts Society
		  began by presenting chamber music concerts in the East Duke
		  Music Room at Duke University. Nelson was chairman of the
		  Chamber Arts Society until 1963. </p>
         
         
         <p>Most of the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Personal and Family
			 Materials</ref> Series, 1913-1966, is made up of
		  correspondence and concerns family matters, health
		  problems, and descriptions of short excursions such as
		  bicycle outings and shopping trips.</p>
         
         
         <p>Some of the correspondence includes information
		  about current world events. In letters to Nelson, economics
		  professor Calvin Bryce Hoover described life in the Soviet
		  Union in 1929, and the upcoming German elections in 1932.
		  In 1939, Shelby McCloy described the reaction in France to
		  the outbreak of World War II and faculty members'
		  assignments during the war. In 1943, several Duke faculty
		  members described the effects of the war on Duke
		  University. Professor William B. Hamilton wrote about how
		  teaching loads had greatly increased due to the large
		  number of V-12 naval and marine cadets who were sent to
		  Duke. Alan K. Manchester described the Navy syllabus used
		  to teach World History and how the war changed civilian
		  life. Several letters from William T. Laprade
		  discussed the impact of the war on the history department
		  and the effect of the draft on faculty. </p>
         
         
         <p>Nelson carried on lengthy correspondence with some
		  of his students, many of whom either went abroad or entered
		  graduate schools, and with a number of scholars at other
		  institutions. Among these scholars are Carl Becker, Roland
		  Bainton, Preserved Smith, George Lincoln Burr, Theodore
		  Mommsen, and Hans Baron. </p>

               <p>Nelson founded the Durham Chamber Arts Society
				in 1945 to offer members of the Durham and Duke communities
				an opportunity to further their appreciation of the fine
				arts. The Chamber Arts Society began by presenting chamber
				music concerts in the East Duke Music Room at Duke
				University. The name of the East Duke Room was later
				changed to the Nelson Music Room in honor of Nelson's
				dedication to the arts and his love of music. Nelson was
				chairman of the Chamber Arts Society until 1963. The
				Chamber Arts Society Series contains financial records,
				membership lists, programs, and correspondence.</p>

               <p>Most of the Personal and Family Materials
				Series is made up of correspondence and concerns family
				matters, health problems, and descriptions of short
				excursions such as bicycle outings and shopping trips.</p>
               
               
               <p>Some of the correspondence includes
				information about current world events. In letters to
				Nelson, economics professor Calvin Bryce Hoover described
				life in the Soviet Union in 1929, and the upcoming German
				elections in 1932. In 1939, Shelby McCloy described the
				reaction in France to the outbreak of World War II and
				faculty members' assignments during the war. In 1943,
				several Duke faculty members described the effects of the
				war on Duke University. Professor William B. Hamilton wrote
				about how teaching loads had greatly increased due to the
				large number of V-12 naval and marine cadets who were sent
				to Duke. Alan K. Manchester described the Navy syllabus
				used to teach World History and how the war changed
				civilian life. Several letters from William T. Laprade
				discussed the impact of the war on the history department
				and the effect of the draft on faculty. </p>
               
               
               <p>Nelson carried on lengthy correspondence with
				some of his students, many of whom either went abroad or
				entered graduate schools, and with a number of scholars at
				other institutions. Among these scholars are Carl Becker,
				Roland Bainton, Preserved Smith, George Lincoln Burr,
				Theodore Mommsen, and Hans Baron. </p>
