         <bioghist>
            
            
            <p>
Samuel Fox Mordecai was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1852, the son of Ellen M. and Samuel Fox Mordecai. He was educated in private schools in Virginia and North Carolina, graduating from the Oxford (NC) Classical and Mathematical School. Between 1870-1875, Mordecai attended the University of Virginia. Primarily a self-educated man, there is no indication that he received a degree from the University of Virginia. </p>
            
            
            <p>
The North Carolina Supreme Court admitted Mordecai to the bar in 1875, beginning a 50 year career of legal work and scholarship. Mordecai practiced in Raleigh with his partner
Richard H. Battle. From 1900 to 1904 he also lectured three times a week at Wake Forest College. Mordecai's success in these positions coupled with his early publications led to          his reputation throughout the state as an excellent lawyer and accomplished scholar.</p>
            
            
            <p>
Following the creation of a law school at Trinity College, Mordecai was named senior professor and chosen to serve as the school's first dean when it opened in 1904. He served in this capacity until his death in 1927. During these years Mordecai was known throughout the campus and the legal community as an able administrator, dedicated teacher, and prolific scholar. He published pamphlets and lectures that were requested from lawyers and legal scholars across the state.</p>
            
            
            <p>
In 1875 Mordecai married Elizabeth D. (Bettie) Grimes. They had nine children: Alfred, Bryan Grimes, Edward Walker, Elizabeth Davis, Ellen, George Washington, Henry Lane,
Margaret Lane, and William Grimes. Samuel Fox Mordecai died in Durham on December 29, 1927.

               <p>Arranged chronologically, the correspondence makes up about 85% of the collection. Some of the 19th century papers are oversized. Most of this early material is related to law cases when Mordecai practiced in Raleigh. Little is revealed of Mordecai himself, mainly the cases he worked. Of particular note, however, is correspondence related to
the Royal Coal and Coke Company of Coal Creek, TN in 1894-1895, when Mordecai served as president of the company. Much of the correspondence from 1897-1899 consists of requests from lawyers and others to purchase copies of his publications "Mechanics' Liens in North Carolina" and "Negotiable Instruments Law in North Carolina". Around the turn of the century there appears more and more letters from lawyers requesting Mordecai's opinion on particular cases or problems.</p>
               
               
               <p>
After being named Dean of the Law School, much of Mordecai's correspondence turns to administrative matters: correspondence with former and potential students; queries        regarding possible faculty positions; and questions about courses and course requirements. Letters of note include those from women in 1917 and 1921 asking about admittance to the law school. (Though women could practice law in NC and women were admitted to Trinity College during this time, they were not admitted to Trinity Law School. The first woman enrolled in the School of Law in 1927.)</p>
               
               
               <p>
Correspondents include: William P. Few; William H. Wannamaker; Henry Mordecai (SFM's son); and Louis R. Wilson, the Librarian of the University of North Carolina.
Also included is correspondence with lawyers and former students. Discarded material consisted of correspondence between Mordecai and printers and publishers across the
country regarding detailed publication matters such as proofs, errors, and billing questions.
</p>
               
               
               <p>
One folder within box 2 contains clippings which date from 1897 to 1927. These include
advertisements/reviews of Mordecai's publications, court calendars, obituaries newsprint), and oversize page proofs from Mordecai's Law Notes.
</p>
               
               
               <p>
Among the later materials are 1953 and 1985 letters from a friend and former students recounting memories of and stories about Mordecai. The 1985 letter and memoir of P.H.
Crawford is particularly valuable in documenting Mordecai's colorful relationship with his students in and out of the classroom. Also included is Mordecai's 1869 grade report
from Oxford (NC) Classical and Mathematical School and an undated letter tracing Mordecai genealogy.
