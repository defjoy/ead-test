		  named her after Mozart's musically talented sister,
		  Nannerl. Her father, James Overholser, a Presbyterian
		  minister, went on to earn a doctorate in theology and
		  taught religion and theology at St. Andrews Presbyterian
		  College in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Her mother, Grace
		  Overholser White, worked as a reporter before marriage and
		  then, later in life, taught English and served as dean at
		  St. Andrews. </p>

		  Ideology</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1982). She
		was vice president of the American Political Science
		Association from 1988 to 1990. </p>
