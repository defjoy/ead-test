         <p>The Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture (MLWC) was established in 1983 to share information about Africana and African-American culture with both the Duke and Durham communities. It is named for the jazz pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams who was a Duke Artist-in-Residence from 1977 until her death in 1981. The Mary Lou Williams Center (as described on its website) seeks to:</p>
         
         
         <p>"â€¦ promote racial understanding, build community, and foster an appreciation for and increase knowledge of Black people, Black history, Black culture, and the vast contributions of people of the African Diaspora. We provide programs and services which contribute to the successful academic and personal development of Black students at Duke University and positively impact the lives of all those whom they encounter. We seek to be a hub for information and activity related to Black students, alumni, and other Black members of the Duke community. We welcome all who seek to engage with and be empowered by a greater understanding of Black experience."
