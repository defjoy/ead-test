         <abstract>The
		  Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU) was the
		  student government at Duke from 1967 to 1993. It originated
		  in March 1967 when the student body voted to merge the
		  Men's Student Government Association and the Women's
		  Student Government Association. ASDU consisted of an
		  executive branch and a legislative branch. A student
		  referendum in April 1993 replaced ASDU with a new
		  organization, Duke Student Government, in which the
		  legislative and executive branches were consolidated. ASDU
		  records consist of minutes, correspondence, legislation,
		  reports, printed matter, judicial decisions, charters,
		  memoranda, speeches, receipts, vouchers, and other records.
		  The ASDU records provide insight into student life during a
		  time when students were becoming more active in university
		  affairs. The records also document student organizations at
		  Duke at this time and demonstrate some of the services
		  provided to students by ASDU.

         <p>The Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU),
		  the student government from 1967-1993, originated in March
		  1967, when the student body voted to merge the Men's
		  Student Government Association and the Women's Student
		  Government Association. ASDU began its duties in the Fall
		  of 1967 with Jon Kinney serving as the first President.</p>
         
         
         <p>ASDU was divided into Executive and Legislative
		  branches. The Executive was made up of the President, Vice
		  President(s), other officers, and the Executive cabinet.
		  Officers were elected to one-year terms. The President had
		  veto power over legislation passed by the Legislature. The
		  Legislature consisted of representatives elected by members
		  of individual schools and colleges and met weekly. The
		  Legislature was responsible for enacting legislation
		  pertaining to student welfare, chartering all student
		  organizations, and approving Presidential appointments. A
		  President's veto could be overturned by a two-thirds
		  majority vote. A Speaker was elected to preside over the
		  Legislature.</p>
         
         
         <p> A student referendum passed in April 1993
		  replaced ASDU with a new student government which featured
		  the consolidation of the legislative and executive
		  branches. The new organization was called the Duke Student
		  Government (DSG).</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The records of the Associated Students of Duke
		  University span from 1965-1993, covering the years that
		  ASDU existed, as well as a few items prior to the
		  establishment of ASDU in 1967. The bulk of the material
		  focuses on the 1970s and early 1980s. The records consist
		  of agendas and minutes, charters, correspondence and
		  memoranda, resolutions and statutes, reports, studies,
		  financial material, photographs, newspaper clippings and
		  other printed matter.</p>
         
         
         <p>The ASDU records provide insight into student life
		  during a time when students were becoming more visible on
		  campus and more active in university affairs. The
		  collection is useful in examining issues that were
		  important to students in the 1970s and 1980s and the
		  actions taken on those issues; how effective student
		  government was during this period; and also illuminates
		  student organizations at Duke at this time -- both what
		  they were and what they did. The records also demonstrate
		  some of the services provided to students by ASDU: the Bail
		  Loan Fund; Legal assistance; van/shuttle services; and the
		  distribution of the Student Activities fee. </p>
         
         
         <p>Additional ASDU records can be found inter-filed
		  with Duke Student Government records. Please contact
		  University Archives for additional information.</p>

               <p>The minutes and agendas within this series are
				divided between the two branches of ASDU: the Legislature
				and Executive. Minutes are arranged chronologically within
				each branch. The Legislative minutes (1967-1986) usually
				include an Executive report, committee reports, budget
				concerns, chartering of organizations, and votes on
				legislation. Minutes for the academic years 1980-1981 to
				1982-1983 are especially thorough. They were kept in large
				binders known as legislative packets (since discarded) and
				include copies of committee minutes and legislation.</p>
               
               
               <p>The Executive minutes (1969-1971; 1975-1989)
				are often handwritten and less formal than the Legislative.
				Also included are minutes from a special meeting between
				the Legislature and Executive on March 15, 1982 called to
				discuss problems with the organization of ASDU -- primarily
				the problems that accompany a government with two separate
				bodies.</p>
               
               
               <p>The Minutes, coupled with the Legislation
				series (Box 2), provide the most complete picture of what
				ASDU did and the issues that concerned students.</p>

               <p>This series demonstrates one of ASDU's primary
				functions, passing legislation chiefly pertaining to the
				welfare of Duke's student body. Subjects of legislation
				reflect student life on campus. Topics include pickets and
				protests, drug policy, building usage, curriculum,
				financial aid, residential life, housing, and other areas
				of student interest. Of particular note are bills
				concerning the Young (Student) Trustee, Student Activities
				fee, the need for a new university union, and the Ice Cream
				Act of 1968.</p>
               
               
               <p>Most bills include a description, date, and
				signatures of approval. Lists of statutes and resolutions
				present can act as an index to the actual records. Also
				included within this series are budgetary statutes, by-laws
				of the association, copies of the ASDU constitution with
				revisions, and a 1973 guide to parliamentary procedure in
				the legislature.</p>
               
               
               <p>Note: Legislation from 1980-1983 can be found

               <p>This series is arranged chronologically by
				year and alphabetically by subject within each year.
				Records include account books, treasurer's reports, budget

               <p> A majority of the material deals with student
				organizations and clubs. This includes allocations,
				budgets, budget recommendations, subsidy requests, income
				statements, and audits. ASDU was responsible for allocating
				funds to student organizations and sports clubs. In Spring
				1970 ASDU gained control over the distribution of the
				Student Activities fee. After receiving budget requests
				from organizations in the spring, ASDU's budget commission
				determined an amount to charge each student entering the
				following fall. The proposal for the Student Activities fee
				is contained within this series. The records related to
				student organizations also provide insight into the
				activities of individual organizations as the organizations
				justify budget requests by listing any activities or events
				they have planned for the year.</p>
               
               
               <p>Another folder of note is that regarding the
				ASDU Legal Services (1978-1979), a program that enabled
				undergraduates to speak with local lawyers about legal
				troubles or questions.</p>

               <p>Another responsibility of ASDU was the
				chartering of student organizations. Once an organization
				received a charter it became eligible for many privileges
				including annual allocation of ASDU fees, use of University
				legal services and purchasing power, and priority in the
				use of University facilities. </p>
               
               
               <p> The Charters subseries consists of charter
				records and charter requests and have been left in their
				original chronological arrangement. This arrangement shows
				what organizations were chartered by ASDU in a given year.
				However, it does not allow for a quick search for a
				specific organization, unless the researcher can provide an
				approximate date. Records of charters are just that,
				consisting of no more than name, date, and signatures of
				approval. Charter requests, filled out by the organization,
				often include lists of officers, a description of the
				organization and its purpose, and how long the organization
				has been active at Duke. </p>
               
               
               <p> Alphabetical files on individual
				organizations comprise the second half of this series. The
				files usually contain budget requests and charter records
				and requests and may include lists of officers or members
				as well. Among the many clubs are the Kung-Fu Club, the
				Woman's Alliance, and the Duke Jazz Ensemble. Also of note
				are photographs and correspondence related to a 1978-1979
				yearbook of African-Americans at Duke called "Ebony
				Visions" (never published).</p>

               <p>The series of Committee files consists of ASDU
				standing committees and University committees on which ASDU
				members served. ASDU committees were appointed by the
				Speaker primarily to research and review proposed bills and
				to make recommendations, such as to support or oppose a
				bill, to the Legislature. Bills were usually sent to a
				specific committee depending on subject: Academics,
				Athletics and Physical Plant, External Affairs, and
				University Affairs. Other ASDU committee files include
				multiple Task Forces: Black Studies (1975), Judicial System
				(1978) and Dining Halls (1979).</p>
               
               
               <p> Non-ASDU committees include Undergraduate
				Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS) Committee on
				the Curriculum and the UFCAS Committee on Admissions and
				Financial Aid. Also present are files on the Residential
				Life Committee and the Student-Faculty-Administration
				Committee. The latter pre-dates ASDU (1966-1968) but
				included representatives of the Men's and Women's Student
				Government Associations.</p>

               <p>This series houses the correspondence of the
				ASDU Executive with bulk dates, 1970-1977. A majority of
				the series is broken down by office, not individual holding
				the office. For example, one folder has correspondence of
				the Attorney General, 1973-1978. Acid-free paper has been
				added within each folder dividing years and, therefore,
				individuals holding the particular office. Files also
				include vice-president, business manager, treasurer, and
				speaker of the legislature. The correspondence of the ASDU
				President has been separated by year with the name of each
				president on the folder as well. In a few instances, the
				incoming and outgoing correspondence of the president is in
				separate folders.</p>
               
               
               <p> Other files consist of memoranda between
				executives and correspondence with University
				administrators (list of administrators within the folders).
				Also included are "how to" memoranda and handwritten notes
				apparently passed on from one president to the next.</p>
