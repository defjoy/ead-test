         <p>The Duke University Debate Team was formed around
		  1897 at Trinity College (now Duke University). The team
		  hosted many tournaments against regional colleges and
		  universities, and traveled to compete in regional and
		  national events. English Professor Joseph C. Wetherby was
		  the longtime coach of the team, from about 1947 until 1976.
		  Wetherby was also an officer in the Speech Association of
		  America (now the Speech Communication Association). Under
		  Professor Wetherby's direction, the Duke University Debate
		  Team won state, regional, and national honors. </p>
         
         
         <p>In 1954, the Speech Association of America
		  announced a national topic that would test Duke
		  University's tradition of academic freedom: "Resolved: That
		  the United States should extend diplomatic recognition to
		  the Communist government of China." In preparation for
		  competition, Edwin Chapman, Jr., a Duke University freshman
		  from Newport News, Va., wrote his congressman,
		  Representative Edward J. Robeson, Jr., requesting
		  information on the topic. Robeson promptly replied,
		  expressing amazement "that such a topic ... was even
		  seriously considered by any group of persons who are
		  normally intelligent and responsibly informed." He advised
		  Chapman not to debate the positive position "as quotations
		  from your statements may embarrass you for the rest of your
		  life." Additionally, the congressman requested the names of
		  the Debate Club faculty advisor at Duke and the members of
		  the National Debating Council. </p>
         
         
         <p>Shortly following that correspondence, Professor
		  Wetherby warned his fellow coaches of possible trouble with
		  the debate topic in the regional newsletter of Tau Kappa
		  Alpha, the national forensic honor society. Before long,
		  the Associated Press had reported the Duke incident along
		  with a growing nationwide controversy. The biggest story
		  concerned President Eisenhower being questioned about
		  directives from the Secretaries of the Army and Navy
		  forbidding the teams at West Point and Annapolis from
		  debating the topic. </p>
         
         
         <p>In support of uncensored discussion, Professor
		  Wetherby appeared on a
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">See It Now</title> television
		show with Wayne C. Eubank of the University of New Mexico,
		President of Tau Kappa Alpha. Immediately after the
		program, Wetherby began receiving mostly favorable letters
		and telegrams from throughout the country. The president of
		Duke University, A. Hollis Edens, understood the
		significance of the issue, and did not interfere with
		either the student group or its faculty advisor. The Speech
		Association of American ultimately retained the debate
		topic and students participated in the national competition
		with no major conflicts.</p>
         
         
         <p>Other events in team history during the 1960s
		  include a May 1960 appearance on the nationally-televised
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">College Bowl.</title> A subset
		of the Debate Team competed on the show, winning against
		Antioch College and Michigan State University. In 1964, two
		Duke University Debate Team members went to the Federal
		Penitentiary in Atlanta, Ga. to debate with prisoners on
		the topics of "Resolved: that the federal government should
		guarantee an opportunity for higher education to all
		qualified high school graduates." In 1966, the team won the
		national collegiate championship, after sixteen rounds of
		debates against Butler University and Vanderbilt
		University. Duke University also had an all-women debate
		team for a brief time.</p>
         
         
         <p>The Duke University chapter of Delta Sigma Rho-Tau
		  Kappa Alpha, the intercollegiate forensics honor society,
		  was established around 1916. The honor society is devoted
		  to the ideals of public speaking and forensics excellence.
		  Membership in the honor society allows Duke University to
		  participate in elite competitions.</p>
         
         
         <p> As of 2003, the Debate Team (now Duke Debate) is
		  active at Duke University. </p>
