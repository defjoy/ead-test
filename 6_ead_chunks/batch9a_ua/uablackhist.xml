         <p>The history of integration at Duke University
		  spans more than one hundred years. In 1896, Trinity College
		  was the first white institution in the South to invite
		  Booker T. Washington to speak on campus. In 1948, students
		  of the Divinity School petitioned for the admission of
		  African Americans to the university. It was only within the
		  last forty years that university policies changed so that
		  black people could become a part of the life of Duke
		  University as students, faculty, and administrators. The
		  Black History at Duke Reference Collection chronicles the
		  events that were part of this change. The following
		  timeline, partially adapted from the book
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Legacy, 1963-1993: Thirty
		  Years of African-American Students at Duke
		  University</title>, gives a historical overview of some of
		the events that are documented in this collection. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection contains publications, fliers,
		  reports, memos, handbooks, manuals, lists, clippings, and a
		  bibliography. The collection is divided into six series:
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">The End of Segregation</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Black Faculty</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Black Studies Program</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">Student Groups</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Public Forums</ref>, and
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Clippings </ref>.</p>
         
         
         <p> The first series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">The End of Segregation</ref>,
		  includes a bibliography, background materials about
		  desegregation efforts, statistics, reports, and memos. The
		  second series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Black Faculty</ref>, includes
		  clippings, and a list of black professors, assistant
		  professors, lecturers, non-tenure track instructors,
		  graduate teaching and research assistants. The appendix to
		  the list includes the Medical School and School of Nursing
		  faculty. </p>
         
         
         <p> In 1968, there were discussions on campus about
		  establishing a black studies or Afro-American studies
		  program, but no action was taken by the university. One of
		  the demands of the students who took over the Allen
		  Building on Feb. 13, 1969, was for the establishment of a
		  fully accredited department of Afro-American Studies. On
		  May 2, 1969, the Black Studies Committee submitted a
		  proposal to the Undergraduate Faculty Council of the Arts
		  and Sciences for the creation of the Black Studies Program
		  and the courses were approved by the curriculum committee.
		  Walter Burford was named program head in 1970. The third
		  series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Black Studies Program</ref>,
		  chronicles some of the history of this program and includes
		  drafts of proposals, enrollment statistics, flyers,
		  photocopies of clippings, and other materials. </p>
         
         
         <p> The fourth series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">Student Groups</ref>, contains
		  materials from a variety of groups. Included are: the
		  Afro-American Society, the Association of African Students,
		  the Black Student Alliance, the Black Graduate and
		  Professional Student Association, Black Fraternities and
		  Sororities, and others. The fifth series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Public Forums</ref>, includes
		  materials on a number of speakers, rallies, demonstrations,
		  boycotts; one newspaper advertisement; and one Internet
		  site. The sixth series,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Clippings </ref>, contains mostly
		  photocopies of newspaper articles. The clippings are from
		  1967-2001 and undated, and cover a wide variety of topics. Of
		  note is a series of articles that appeared in the

               <p>In 1968, there were discussions on campus
				about establishing a black studies or Afro-American studies
				program, but no action was taken by the university. One of
				the demands of the students who took over the Allen
				Building on Feb. 13, 1969, was for the establishment of a
				fully accredited department of Afro-American Studies. On
				May 2, 1969, the Black Studies Committee submitted a
				proposal to the Undergraduate Faculty Council of the Arts
				and Sciences for the creation of the Black Studies Program
				and the the courses where approved by the curriculum
				committee. Walter Burford was named program head in
				1970.</p>
