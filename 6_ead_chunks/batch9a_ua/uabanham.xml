         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>Katharine May Banham was born 26 May, 1897,
		  Sheffield, England and died 7 May, 1995, in
		  Buckinghamshire, England. Educated at University of
		  Manchester (England), BS., 1919; Cambridge University
		  (England), M.S., 1921, though this institution did not
		  award degrees to women at that time; University of Toronto
		  (Canada), MA., 1923; and University of Montreal, Ph.D.,
		  1934 (Cum Laude), the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D.
		  from that university.</p>
         
         
         <p>After faculty and professional positions in
		  Canada, England, Iowa, and New Jersey, Banham was appointed
		  to the Duke University faculty of psychology as Associate
		  Professor in 1946 and Duke University Associate Professor
		  of Psychology, Emerita in 1967. She was appointed Senior
		  Psychologist at the North Carolina Board of Public Welfare
		  in 1950. In addition to summer positions at the New Jersey
		  Children's Home Society (1948), Children's Services of
		  Cleveland, Ohio (1950), and visiting professor at
		  University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C. (1960 and
		  1962), Banham was appointed as Head Psychologist of the
		  Infant Program at the North Carolina Cerebral Palsy
		  Hospital in 1967 and Consulting Psychologist at Lenox Baker
		  Hospital (formerly called the N.C. Cerebral Palsy Hospital)
		  in 1980. Banham cofounded the Duke University Nursery
		  School in 1946, with Dr. Wally Reichenberg-Hackett, helped
		  to establish the Duke Film Society and the Duke Institute
		  for Learning in Retirement, served in various faculty
		  committees, developed a freshman counseling program, and
		  created psychology courses in the area of infant and child
		  development.</p>
         
         
         <p>Outside of the Duke community, Banham helped to
		  establish many organizations including the Child Guidance
		  Clinic of Durham; the Committee for Successful Aging; the
		  North Carolina Psychological Association; the Altrusa Club,
		  an all-women philanthropic organization; the French Club;
		  and the Photographic Arts Society of Durham. She was a
		  member and officer of many professional organizations in
		  the United States and abroad. She established and funded
		  the Alice C. Hundley Piano Student Award in 1970, for
		  promising piano players between twelve and fourteen years
		  old and the Anne McDougall Memorial Award for women in
		  1985, for women students to pursue study in the broad area
		  of psychology whose education has been interrupted or who
		  have not had the opportunity for college education. Honors
		  and awards received by her include the N.C. Cerebral Palsy
		  Award for Merit (1972) as well as certificates and awards
		  of recognition and merit from regional, national, and
		  international organizations. Published in both English and
		  French, major publications include The Social and Emotional
		  Development of the Preschool Child, (London: Kegan Paul,
		  1931) and Ring and Peg Tests of Behavior Development,
		  (Chicago: Psychometric Affiliates, 1965).</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Katharine May Banham Papers span the years
		  between 1910 and 1995, with the bulk occurring between 1945
		  and 1984. These papers include her master's theses and
		  dissertation work, professional and academic writings, case
		  files, and data documenting psychological experiments that
		  culminated in the development of tests, as well as research
		  articles and one monograph; transcripts of talks and
		  addresses; translations of French psychological texts,
		  teaching materials; administrative records of and records
		  documenting her role in various civic and academic clubs
		  and organizations; professional and personal
		  correspondence; and personal materials including art,
		  photographs, memorabilia, poetry and other personal
		  writings, diaries, biographical information, legal
		  documents, and tapes and transcripts of an oral history
		  interview done in 1980. The main subject areas include
		  Banham's contribution to the profession, her participation
		  in the Duke community, and the Durham community as well as
		  regional, national, and international communities and
		  agencies.</p>
         
         
         <p>The collection chiefly reflects Banham's career as
		  a woman psychologist during a period when there was little
		  support for women in professional or academic careers. The
		  papers document Banham's research and teaching in three
		  countries; her contributions in the areas of child
		  psychology and geriatrics, particularly human social and
		  emotional development; functioning and development of
		  children with cerebral palsy and disabilities; the history
		  and especially the development of psychological testing of
		  children and adults; and parapsychological phenomena.
		  Research and teaching materials are located within the
		  Academic and Professional Psychology series and Duke
		  Activities series. Materials relevant to Banham's
		  professional development are scattered throughout all five
		  series.</p>
         
         
         <p>The collection is also important for the
		  perspective it offers on the Duke University Psychology
		  Department and the Woman's College during the 1940s to the
		  1960s. Information related to both as well as her role in
		  the Admissions and scholarships Committees among other
		  faculty committees (see the folder list located in the
		  description of Duke Activities series), the Duke Preschool,
		  the Duke Film Society, and the Duke Institute for Learning
		  in Retirement can be found primarily in the Duke Activities
		  series. Material regarding the development and teaching of
		  an infant and child psychology curriculum and a series of
		  correspondence with graduate students are also of special
		  interest and can be found in the Duke Activities series.
		  Other materials relating to her contributions to the Duke
		  Community are located in the Academic and Professional
		  Psychology series, the Correspondence series, and the
		  Personal Files series.</p>
         
         
         <p>Banham's contribution to the city of Durham is
		  reflected in the Agency and Club Participation series with
		  the most in depth materials relating to her role in
		  establishing the French Club, the Photographic Arts
		  Society, the Altrusa Club, and the Committee for Successful
		  Aging (which became the Golden Age Society and finally, the
		  Coordinating Council for Senior Citizens), and, to a lesser
		  degree, in the Academic and Professional Psychology series
		  specifically in her role as one of the founding
		  psychologists of the Durham Child Guidance Clinic. Banham
		  co-founded the North Carolina Psychological Association in
		  addition to being an active member and officer of other
		  regional, national, and international organizations such as
		  the League of Women Voters, the American Association of
		  University Women, and the International Council of Women
		  Psychologists.</p>
         
         
         <p>Banham's life was defined by her professional and
		  academic commitments and so her closest relationships were
		  with her colleagues and the many individuals to whom she
		  gave her time and the benefit of her professional skills.
		  The Correspondence and personal series best reflect her
		  tireless efforts on behalf of the people with whom she come
		  into contact. Her papers are particularly useful as they
		  document the period of the 1920s through the 1960s in
		  England, Canada, and especially the United States from the
		  perspective of a highly educated, professional woman.</p>

                  <p>Comprised of Banham's collection of 3x5
				  cards of bibliographic citations from 1948-1962; talks and
				  addresses; writings including student papers and master's
				  theses, essays, reviews, translations of various articles
				  in French as well as books by Alfred Binet and Remy
				  Chauvin, and research articles; research notes and
				  materials relating to the development of psychological
				  tests including School Readiness Inventory, Social
				  Competence Inventory for Adults, Maturity Level for School
				  Entrance and Reading Readiness, Quick Screening Scale of
				  Mental Development, Ring and Peg Tests of Mental
				  Development, Social Competence Inventory for Older Persons,
				  human and animal empathy tests, visual irradiation tests,
				  and various parapsychological tests; administrative
				  materials related to research and testing; materials
				  documenting professional positions at the McGill University
				  Nursery School in Canada, the Leicester School
				  Psychological Service in England, Division of Psychological
				  Services in Iowa, the New Jersey State Board of Children's
				  Guardians, the Durham Child Guidance Center, the North
				  Carolina Cerebral Palsy Hospital, the North Carolina State
				  Board of Public Welfare, the Duke University Nursery
				  School, Lenox Baker Hospital (formerly the N.C. Cerebral
				  Palsy Hospital), and numerous consultancy positions for
				  agencies and individuals throughout North Carolina;
				  professional and academic interests files; news and
				  magazine clippings; and curricula vitae from 1928-1983.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The series documents Banham's propensity to
				  work on several projects and in more than one position at
				  any given time throughout her career. While she was
				  developing new psychological tests, writing essays and
				  articles for various audiences, teaching and advising
				  undergraduate and graduate students, and doing secretarial
				  tasks in the psychology department, Banham worked as a
				  consultant doing psychological evaluation for individuals
				  and agencies while helping to establish the Duke Nursery
				  School. The series also documents Banham's extensive travel
				  through England, Canada, and the United States in her many
				  academic and professional capacities. Finally, the series
				  provides a picture of Banham's research and professional
				  methodologies, the variety of her intellectual interests,
				  and the depth and breadth of her commitment and service to
				  her profession and the individuals with whom she came into
				  contact throughout her career.</p>

                     <p>The Department of Psychology subseries is
					 further divided into three categories: history and
					 development, course materials, and correspondence with
					 graduate students. The history and development section
					 spans the years 1946-1986 contains materials documenting
					 Banham's role in starting the clinical psychology program;
					 department of psychology colloquia announcements,
					 memoranda, notices, a description of the history of the
					 department; inventories from psychological test library
					 maintained by Banham. Also included is a record of graduate
					 student research during the 1940s, 50s, and 60s along with
					 copies of qualifying exams taken by Ph.D. students during
					 this same period. The course materials section spans the
					 years of Banham's professorship at Duke and contains
					 bibliographies of psychological texts, course syllabi and
					 packets, and lecture notes for classes in abnormal, social,
					 behavioral, and clinical psychology and particularly for
					 the child psychology curriculum. Course materials from
					 Banham's two summer teaching positions at the University of
					 British Columbia are included here. The third section
					 contains correspondence with nine graduate students. One of
					 these individuals maintained a correspondence with Banham
					 for over thirty years (1949-1985). The materials in this
					 section are of particular interest as the practice of
					 faculty-student correspondence was uncommon during this
					 period.</p>

					 years between 1935 and 1985 and includes correspondence,
					 memoranda, and acquisition lists. The papers broadly
					 reflect Banham's service within the psychology department
					 as she represented the department to the university
					 libraries as well as concerned herself with the
					 departmental library. Particular areas of interest include
					 Banham's role on the Woman's College Library Committee,
					 acquisitions in the discipline of psychology between the
					 years 1935 and 1985, and the library within the Psychology
					 Department. The subseries provides an example of faculty
					 involvement in library matters and collection
					 development.</p>
