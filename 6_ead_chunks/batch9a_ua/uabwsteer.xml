         <p>taken from the Executive Summary of the Black on White Final Report (February 1989)</p>
         
         
         <p>The Black on White Steering Committee was appointed by Malcolm-Gillis, Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Graduate School.  Its composition consisted of key faculty, student leaders, administrators, and staff whose purpose was to gather institutional support for a university-wide symposium that would address specifically the kind of environment provided for black students at Duke.  </p>
         
         
         <p>The symposium titled "Black on White: An Exploration of the Issues Surrounding the Experience of Black Students on White Campuses" was held October 24-25, 1988.  The primary goal of this symposium was to look at the issues surrounding the experiences of black students on white campuses, and how Duke as an educational institution can create a more supportive environment for minorities.  The symposium was designed to lay the groundwork and initiate the dialogue to: (1) increase awareness of the prevailing values, attitudes, and prejudices regarding black/white issues on Duke's campus; and (2) increase sensitivity to the effects that racial misperceptions have on the quality of campus life for all students.
