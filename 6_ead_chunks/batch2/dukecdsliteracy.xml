         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>The Literacy through Photography (LTP) program in the
		  Durham Public Schools was started in 1989 by photographer,
		  teacher, and writer Wendy Ewald. The program encourages
		  students to find their voice through photographs and
		  written text; students photograph scenes from their lives
		  and then learn to develop and print the film in the school
		  darkroom. These images become the catalyst for subsequent
		  written investigation of self, community, family, and
		  dreams. LTP provides training to middle and elementary
		  school teachers, and partners university students and
		  community volunteers with LTP classrooms.</p>
         
         
         <p>Since 1990, LTP has worked intensively in Durham
		  with children of diverse ages and backgrounds. The emphasis
		  on children's lives and environments as the source of their
		  own creative expression, as well as the focus on the
		  material procedures of photography, has gained
		  international attention. LTP has been invited to give
		  workshops and train teachers and arts organizations
		  throughout the United States and internationally, setting a
		  standard for innovative arts education programs.</p>
         
         
         <p>In 1994, LTP joined the Duke Center for Documentary Studies. From 1994-1999 the majority of LTP materials
		  produced in classrooms were either given back to the
		  students or remained in the classroom with the teacher. In
		  1999, LTP made plans to create an archive, and began the
		  process of collecting past work from LTP teachers. The task
		  of collecting and organizing this work, from 1994-1999, was
		  undertaken by Julia Beck Hoggson in the fall of 1999. The
		  material was transferred to the Rubenstein Library in 2002.</p>
         
         
         <p>The LTP project in Arusha, Tanzania, began in 2004 when Sister Cities of Durham brought two Tanzanian teachers to the Center for Documentary Studies to attend an LTP workshop. Building on these connections, LTP staff and Duke Engage students traveled to Arusha in 2008 and 2009 to offer workshops to hundreds of primary-school teachers, from all over the district, and to co-teach lessons that involved more than 2,450 students. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Duke University Center for Documentary Studies
		  Literacy Through Photography Records comprise negatives,
		  contact sheets, and written work (generally handwritten or
		  printed observations, comments, stories, poems, drawings)
		  documenting school children’s views of their community,
		  Durham, NC. The materials would be useful to those
		  interested in visual culture, the psychogeography of
		  children, and Durham history, society and living
		  environment, as well as those interested in pedagogy and
		  developing an arts-based curriculum in public schools. The
		  units collected and organized in the Records are LTP class
		  projects, sorted first by format, then chronologically.
		  </p>
         
         
         <p>Along with the physical negatives, contact sheets,
		  and writings transferred to the Rubenstein Library in 2002, LTP
		  coordinators provided detailed supplementary information
		  about the compilation, organization, and selection process
		  of the collection, as well as a finding aid in the form of
		  an Excel database. The Excel file is a master database of
		  individual student projects organized by year, and sortable
		  by other variables; the database is accessible
		  electronically at the Rubenstein Library. A print copy of the database
		  and other supporting documentation is also available in the
		  RMBSCL inventory file, and should be consulted by patrons
		  using this collection.</p>
         
         
         <p>The collection also includes 56 exhibit-quality color prints of LTP in Tanzania include images of children learning to use digital cameras, demonstrating their literacy skills, and exhibiting their projects. Also includes images of some volunteers, LTP staff, and Tanzanian teachers.</p>

               <p>The LTP project in Arusha, Tanzania, began in 2004 when Sister Cities of Durham brought two Tanzanian teachers to the Center for Documentary Studies to attend an LTP workshop. Building on these connections, LTP staff traveled to Arusha in 2008 and 2009 to offer workshops to hundreds of primary-school teachers, from all over the district, and to co-teach lessons that involved more than 2,450 students. These experiences culminated with a public exhibition of children's work.</p>
               
               
               <p>The 56 prints in this series document the collaborative LTP process in Tanzania, including children's assignments; group work; instruction in photography, history, geography, life skills, math, and science; and exhibitions of the final projects created by the children in the program. Most prints are approximately 13x19 or 12x16 digital color prints; there are also three 16x20 prints. Captions and identification numbers are included when known.</p>

                  <p>This project at Themi Secondary School began with a history lesson about how East Africans were enslaved through the sale of prisoners and people with debt, ambush, and direct raid on vulnerable villages. Following this lecture, students moved freely around the schoolyard as they considered the best backgrounds and angles for pictures representing these enslavement tactics. Once they made their photographs, students wrote about the images from either the perspective of an enslaved person or that of a slave trader. 17" x 13" digital pigment prints (3 prints).</p>
