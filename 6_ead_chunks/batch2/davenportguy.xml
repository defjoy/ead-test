         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>Box 1 of the collection contains a few letters from Davenport, primarily written to Dorothy E. Roberts, a secretary in Duke University's English Department. There are clippings regarding his his career and family, along with book reviews written by him or about his work. Also includes collected contributions to a symposium (1974) on Davenport's work printed in the serial <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Margins</title>. Included are the author's short stories "A Gingham Dress," "Belinda's World Tour," and "Juno of the Veii," as well as his article "The Symbol of the Archiaic."</p>
         
         
         <p>Box 2 of the collection contains letters and postcards from Davenport to Abbott (Tom) Gleason. There are 68 pieces of correspondence, with all but three from 1960-1962; others are from 1963, 1964, 1966, and one undated. Totals include 37 letters (20 ALS and 17 TLS); 30 postcards; one holiday card. The 37 letters amount to 71 pages, plus 31 postcards and a card, equals 102 "pages" of text, mostly concentrated in three years. Three letters are on airmail stationary; from the lot there are only two absent envelopes. </p>
         
         
         <p>The correspondence discusses both parties' personal and intellectual lives. Davenport confesses his attraction for Gleason and his struggle with Gleason's lack of reciprocation. Davenport asserts, however, his ability to refrain from acting on his attraction. Many of the letters recount daily life, some in a very lyrical and detailed manner, while other letters raise general intellectual inquiry on subjects such as art, photography, quotations, etc. Discussion passes about the works and progress of Davenport's contemporaries, including prominent writers such as Ezra Pound and Samuel Beckett. Postcards and other letters document travel.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

                  <p>Contains 68 pieces of correspondence, consisting of letters, postcards, and a card. The correspondence discusses both parties' personal and intellectual lives. Davenport confesses his attraction for Gleason and his struggle with Gleason's lack of reciprocation. Davenport asserts, however, his ability to refrain from acting on his attraction. Many of the letters recount daily life, some in a very lyrical and detailed manner, while other letters raise general intellectual inquiry on subjects such as art, photography, quotations, etc. Discussion passes about the works and progress of Davenport's contemporaries, including prominent writers such as Ezra Pound and Samuel Beckett. Postcards and other letters document travel. Materials have been arranged chronologically.</p>
