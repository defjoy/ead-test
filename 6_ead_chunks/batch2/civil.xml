         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The United States Commission on Civil Rights North Carolina
Advisory Committee Papers span the years 1949 to 1962, but fall chiefly
in the period 1957 to 1962. They consist largely of correspondence, but
also include reports, drafts of reports, minutes of meetings, and
completed survey forms. Statistical charts and maps, transcripts of
telephone interviews, signed affidavits, printed material which includes
reports of other organizations, articles, brochures, and press releases,
mailing lists, notes, and clippings are also included. The collection
documents methods of data collection for social research that is directed
to governmental policy change. The research particularly focuses on
racial discrimination against and the civil rights of African Americans,
and to a lesser extent Native Americans, in North Carolina. Most of the
correspondence was generated from the office of Chairman McNeill
Smith, and the collection therefore does not represent the work of other
Committee members, except for their communications with Smith. </p>
         
         
         <p>The Committee requested statistical information on African
Americans and Native Americans from public libraries, high schools,
lending agencies, health care facilities, employers and county boards of
election. Completed questionnaire forms exist for the Public Libraries,
Administration of Justice, Education, Employment, and Voting studies.
Formal complaints in areas of potential study were heard and recorded
at open hearings held throughout the state. More qualitative information
was obtained through correspondence, meetings and telephone
interviews. Transcripts of Smith's phone conversations can be found in
the Education, Employment, Medical Care and Voting Series.</p>
         
         
         <p>Correspondence in each series, including alphabetical files,
pertains to the studies, background information, survey forms, data, and
final reports. In many cases, completed survey forms, which exist for the
Public Libraries, Administration of Justice, Education and Voting
studies, are attached to correspondence. Form letters in the
correspondence of the Housing and Voting Series request specific
information from lending agencies and county boards of election. There
are responses to questions in letter form which, in the case of the
Housing Series, comprise a large portion of the correspondence.
Scattered letters from North Carolinians express segregationist views and
hostility to research efforts.</p>
         
         
         <p>In every series, the major correspondence is that of McNeill Smith
with researchers and Commission and Committee members.
Occasionally, communications from federal commission officers appear,
most notably Cornelius Cotter (Assistant Staff Director), Henry Shine,
Gordon Tiffany (Staff Director), and Peter Sussman (Deputy Assistant
Staff Director). These usually pertain to the development and approval of
questionnaire forms and the editing and publication of reports, or
provide supplementary data.</p>
         
         
         <p>The General Series documents committee work on both national
and state levels. Correspondence files contain information on the
creation and organization of the committee and its work, as well as
information on every study. There are letters from the federal
commission concerning new projects, surveys, data, reports, and
national and regional conferences. Other files contain information on the
proceedings of open meetings held by the committee between 1959 and
1961. </p>
         
         
         <p>The voting study was mandated by the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
The Voting Series contains correspondence pertaining to the collection
of registration statistics with regard to race in North Carolina, as well as
completed survey forms from almost all of the 100 counties in North
Carolina. Repeated communications from McNeill Smith to registration
officials and lawyers in every county are included. The series also
contains seventeen signed affidavit forms attesting to discriminatory
voting practices.</p>
         
         
         <p>Discriminatory practices in the following areas were investigated:
employment of blacks in law enforcement agencies (Administration of
Justice Series); employment and facilities in public libraries (General
Series); enrollment in accredited high schools, illiteracy, and admission
to industrial education centers (Education Series); and employment of
blacks in state organizations and companies with government contracts
(Employment Series). The ability of blacks to obtain federally-
sponsored loans for housing and their role in urban-renewal (Housing
Series); admission of blacks to health care facilities (Medical Care
Series); and voter registration procedures and participation of blacks in
political elections (Voting Series) were other areas of investigation. </p>
         
         
         <p>Local experts in the fields of medicine, political science and law
researched and wrote reports, and compiled statistical charts. General
legal research was carried out by Dan Pollitt of the Universitiy of North
Carolina Law School, some of whose work is found in the General
Series. Others included: Donald Matthews of the UNC Political Science
Department (Voting), John Hope II of Fisk University in Tennessee
(Education), Dickson Phillips of the UNC Law School (Administration of
Justice), Howard Miller of Raleigh (Industrial Education), and Dr. M. B.
Bethel of Chapel Hill (Medical Care). Correspondence between committee
members, primarily McNeill Smith, and these individuals is found in the
General, Administration of Justice, Education, Medical Care and
Voting series. Organizations involved in the committee's research
included: The American Friends Service Committee, the Southern
Regional Council, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction,
the UNC-Chapel Hill Institute of Government, the North Carolina
Employment Security Commission, the Southern Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools, the North Carolina AFL-CIO, and the North
Carolina State Board of Health. </p>
         
         
         <p>Published reports of the committee's work are in the Public
Documents and Maps Department, in the Pamphlet Collection and in the
stacks of Perkins Library. Related collections in the Special Collections
Department include the Asa T. Spaulding Papers and the Robert S.
Rankin Papers.</p>
