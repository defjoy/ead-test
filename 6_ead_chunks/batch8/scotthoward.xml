         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Howard Scott Papers</title> span
		the years 1921-1984, although the bulk of materials covers the period from the
		1930s to the 1950s, documenting Scott's career in outdoor advertising as a
		billboard designer and graphic artist. The papers include correspondence
		(including two letters from
		Norman Rockwell), newspaper and magazine clippings,
		awards, and school yearbooks relating to Scott's personal and professional
		life, in addition to photographs,
		sketches,
		lithographs and reprints of outdoor advertising
		images for clients such as
		Amoco,
		Chesterfield (Liggett and Myers),
		Esso and
		Mobil oil products,
		DeSoto,
		Ford, and
		Nash automobiles,
		H.J. Heinz Co.,
		Lever Brothers,
		Pabst and
		Schlitz beers, World War II-era programs such as the

		USO and Navy recruitment, and the 1939-1940
		World's Fair. The collection is arranged into four
		series--the <emph render="bold">General Papers Series</emph>, the
		<emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Graphic
		Design, Artwork and Sketches Series</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Memorabilia Series</emph>.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">General Papers Series</emph> includes
		  correspondence, biographical information, clippings, sketches, school
		  yearbooks, publications and certificates of recognition. Included are articles
		  about <emph render="doublequote">Elmer,</emph> the character created by Scott
		  to help promote the 1940
		  World's Fair.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> includes
		  approximately 100
		  prints and
		  transparencies depicting
		  billboard images for a variety of products, such as
		  Esso oil and gasoline,
		  Heinz ketchup,
		  Knickerbocker beer,
		  Swan (Lever Brothers) soap and
		  Twenty Grand cigarettes. Several of the
		  photographs show models in poses which served as the basis for billboard
		  images. Some of the images are signed by artists other than Scott. In addition,
		  approximately 20 photographs depict Scott at various ages, and at work in his
		  studio.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Graphic Design, Artwork, and Sketches
		  Series</emph> includes
		  sketches and
		  proof sheets for
		  billboards and
		  outdoor advertising campaigns created by Scott, as
		  well as a sampling of outdoor
		  poster work by other artists. Major clients include
		  Chesterfield cigarettes;
		  Knickerbocker,
		  Pabst and
		  Schlitz beers;
		  DeSoto,
		  Ford and
		  Nash automobiles;
		  Amoco and
		  Mobil gas and oil; along with a sampling of World
		  War II poster designs including Navy recruiting and the USO. Media include
		  pencil and ink
		  sketches,
		  watercolors,
		  lithographs, and
		  oil paintings. A large mixed media
		  painting depicts an award-winning outdoor design
		  for
		  Ford, with the slogan <emph render="doublequote">He's Doing Fine...He Bought a Ford V-8.</emph>
         
         
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Memorabilia Series</emph> includes awards and
		  trophies that Scott won for his advertising artwork and reflects the esteem
		  with which Scott's work was held by his peers in the outdoor advertising
