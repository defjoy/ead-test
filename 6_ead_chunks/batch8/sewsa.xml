         <p>The Southeastern Women's Studies Association, founded in Atlanta in 1977, is a regional organization under the National Women's Studies Association. SEWSA members includes individuals, institutions, students, and faculty, and the organization serves Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. According to its website, SEWSA is a feminist organization committed to scholarship, activism against oppression and discrimination, and the promotion of women's studies. It does this through a newsletter, annual conferences and workshops, travel grants for students, and networking within various women's studies departments. For more information on SEWSA, refer to their website: http://sewsa.nwsa.org/index.html</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>Accession (2006-0065) contains a variety of administrative, business, financial, and other materials relating to the operation of the Southeastern Women's Studies Association. The majority of the materials date from 1985 through the mid-1990s, with additional items from both before and after that period. </p>
         
         
         <p>Files have been loosely arranged into series. The <emph render="bold">Administrative and Business Records</emph> series includes the organization's bylaws and its subsequent updates; correspondence; agendas and meeting minutes from committees and business meetings; financial statements and accounts; conference proposals and some conference papers; travel grant materials; membership lists and addresses; stationary and other templates; and lists of officers and committee members from various points throughout the organization's history. Conference planning is a large component of this series, resulting in some overlap with the Conferences series. Another notable portion is the files relating to SEWSA's travel grants, which include both applications, acceptances, and information about the grant program. This series has been largely sorted by date, with occassional subjects filed separately.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Conferences</emph> series include conference planning materials, as mentioned above, as well as conference programs and calls for papers announcements. The <emph render="bold">Newsletters </emph>series includes a run of the newsletters as well as newsletter preparation files from the 1980s. Finally, there are also some conference and SEWSA buttons as well as a SEWSA 1985 t-shirt present in the <emph render="bold">Ephemera</emph> series.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
