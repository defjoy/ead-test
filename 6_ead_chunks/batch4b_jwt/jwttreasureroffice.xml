         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p> Treasurer's Office Records span the years from 1928-1952, although the bulk of the
				material dates from 1928 to the 1940s. The collection documents the financial
				operations of JWT offices around the world and to a lesser extent in the United
				States. The materials consist of correspondence, financial records, and legal
				documents relating to the activities of JWT's Treasurer's Office. Correspondents
				include Earle Clark (Treasurer, 1921-39), Donald C. Foote, (Assistant Treasurer in
				charge of accounting and budgeting in JWT's international operations, 1937-52),
				Luther O. Lemon (Assistant Treasurer and Comptroller, 1937-46; Treasurer, 1946-57),
				and Sam Meek (Vice President in charge of International Operations 1930-64); senior
				staff members in domestic and international offices; JWT's legal counsel; and
				representatives from numerous financial institutions. Multinational clients
				represented in the International Offices Series are the Eastman Kodak Company, the
				Kellogg Company, the Gillette Company, RCA, and <emph render="italic">Reader's
					Digest</emph>. International offices well-documented include those in Antwerp,
				Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. Records for many of JWT's
				offices are not included in the Treasurer's Office Records, which indicates that the
				files in their present form may be incomplete.</p>
         
         
         <p> The Domestic Offices Series focuses particularly on the New York, Detroit, and San
				Francisco offices. In addition to documenting routine matters relating to budgets,
				billing, and salaries, the records include material relating to the regulation of
				testimonial advertising by the Federal Trade Commission in 1929-1930.</p>
         
         
         <p> The International Offices Series documents the complex relationship between the New
				York office and the several foreign offices of the company, especially offices in
				Antwerp, Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. A primary focus of the
				series is the legal and financial difficulties JWT faced as it attempted to expand
				abroad during a time of rising nationalism in many of the countries in which the
				company had offices. The impact of World War II on JWT especially the Bombay and
				Paris offices is documented, as well as the impact of the 1947 partition of India on
				JWT operations in India. The files also document JWT's efforts in the 1930s to
				develop radio advertising in Mexico, Belgium, and England. The series is divided
				into the following subseries: JWT International Corporation, Antwerp Office, Berlin
				Office, Bombay Office, Bucharest Office, London Office, and Mexico City Office.</p>

               <p> Chiefly contains the correspondence of JWT Treasurer's Office staff
						(especially Earle Clark and Luther O. Lemon) with company personnel in other
						domestic offices, legal counsel, and banking representatives. The series
						also includes legal documents, memoranda, financial reports, and board
						meeting minutes. The contents are arranged in alphabetical order by subject,
						with the subjects falling into three broad categories: files relating to the
						JWT Advertising Corporation, files relating to JWT domestic offices other
						than the New York Office, and files relating to general financial
						matters.</p>
               
               
               <p> The JWT Advertising Corporation was a subsidiary of the JWT Company
						established in  1931 at One Wall
						Street, New York City, New York, at least partly to facilitate the company's
						work for clients located in Manhattan's financial district. These files
						include corporate documents such as minutes, office leases, profit and loss
						sheets, billings, and tax returns.</p>
               
               
               <p>Treasurer's Office files for offices outside New York
						relate chiefly to San Francisco and
							Detroit, with the bulk addressing routine questions
						relating to office expenditures, overhead charges, and billing procedures.
						These files also contain a memorandum from W. F. Howard to Norman
							H. Strouse (8-31-49, in <emph render="doublequote">Detroit
							Office</emph> folder) presenting a detailed case for the installation of
						air conditioning in the Detroit offices. Records for the payment of several
						thousands of dollars in club fees for Detroit's managerial staff can be
						found in the Detroit Office file in the years  1947-1948. Several letters discuss how to handle
						requests for charitable contributions (Luther O. Lemon to Thelma Hardy,
							 6-13-49, and Luther O. Lemon
						to Fred Fidler,  6-17-49, both in
						the San Francisco Office file; W. F. Howard to Henry C. Flower,  5-25-50, and Norman F. Strouse to
						Luther O. Lemon,  10-17-50, both
						in the Detroit Office file; see also <emph render="doublequote">Subscriptions</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">Veterans Guidance
							in Advertising</emph>).</p>
               
               
               <p>Files relating to general financial matters contain documents on a wide
						variety of topics of interest to the Treasurer's Office. Several folders,
						for example, are devoted to limiting particular kinds of corporate expenses,
						such as telegrams and telephone calls. One folder contains information on
						the New York Disability Benefits Law of 
							1949 and the company's efforts to comply with the new
						regulations, while another folder contains documents discussing the Federal
						Trade Commission's restrictions on the use of testimonials, or <emph render="doublequote">personality advertising.</emph> Yet another folder,
						titled <emph render="doublequote">Unions,</emph> contains a published report
						from the New York Department of Labor ( 
							1942) determining a minimum recommended salary for women
						employees, along with an itemized budget that supports the Department's
						recommendations.</p>

							Donald C. Foote and Earle Clark
						in the Treasurer's Office; and  Sam Meek,
						Vice President in charge of International Operations,  1930-1964) and the managers of the
						international offices. The series also includes legal documents, board
						meeting minutes, and financial reports (such as operating budgets, balance
						sheets, tax assessments, and cash account audits).</p>

               <p>Three broad areas of concern dominate the files: finance, law, and personnel.
						Financial issues include overdue accounts, currency exchange rates, overhead
						charges, stock reclassifications, commission rates, conflicts of interest,
						profits and losses, and tardy expense and revenue reports. </p>

               <p>Most legal questions revolve around the incorporation of the parent company,
						JWT International, and the effort to obtain national charters for the
						various overseas offices--a move calculated to accommodate local clients'
						growing preference for doing business with an agency chartered locally. In
						the cases of the Bucharest and Berlin offices, the local agency was sold to
						national members of the staff because it was impossible to obtain a national
						charter without JWT directors in New York losing their controlling interest
						in the local company. The JWT office managers also reported on tax laws,
						import restrictions and political changes that might affect advertising
						revenues.</p>

               <p>In the area of personnel, a large portion of correspondence deals with salary
						and profit-sharing arrangements for high-ranking members of the managerial
						staff. Also included are disputes regarding expense accounts, Christmas
						bonuses, transfer requests, home leave, and life insurance. Aside from
						revealing employee judgments about the fairness of certain company policies,
						these exchanges also document managers' dissatisfactions with working among
						people of other ethnic backgrounds and the hardships of life in an alien
						society (e.g., separation from family, decreased earnings due to unstable
						currencies, and exposure to tropical illnesses). </p>

								Edward E. Pratt, 
                     L.R. Deke Coleman, 
                     J. H. Cerny, and Rene -P. Jeanneret.
							 The Antwerp file also contains correspondence between Donald
							Foote and managers of offices in Paris, Amsterdam, and the Hague.
							Several issues addressed in the correspondence indicate the challenges
							JWT faced in their overseas operations. For example, an exchange between
							Donald Foote and J. H. Cerny discusses the financial issues involved in
							expanding into radio advertising in Antwerp ( 12-5-34, 1-4-35). Also, Jeanneret commented to Foote ( 6-25-35) about the objections
							Catholic papers raised against advertisements--particularly one that
							depicted women models wearing pants and exposing navel and thighs.
							During World War II, Jeanneret and Coleman reported to Sam Meek on
							conditions in occupied France ( 7-19-40 and 9-10-40).</p>

                  <p>JWT's operations in India were profitable throughout
							World War II, but not without many hardships, including Japanese air
							raids, the threat of conscription of key personnel, and low morale due
							to the postponement of home leave. The political instability surrounding
							India's post-war partitioning also created unfavorable working
							conditions for JWT's employees in India. Several of Fielden's letters to
							New York deal at length with the impact of domestic and international
							politics upon both advertising interests, and the staff's health and
							safety ( 10-28-38, 8-2-40, 10-1-40, 1-7-43, 6-11-46, 9-2-47, 4-4-49, 5-4-49, 6-6-49).</p>

							(letters, 11-17-40, 2-23-42, 10-15-43) outlined the
							obstacles European staff members confronted in maintaining a <emph render="doublequote">European lifestyle</emph> in India. Also, in a
							dispute about his expense account, Peterson alluded to certain
							entertainment expenses--which he felt obliged to incur for his
							guests--related to an arrangement for several young women to attend a
							business dinner (letter to Fielden, 12-16-48). And in reinstating life insurance for the Indian
							personnel, management encountered resentment from employees who were
							unwilling to designate themselves by race as either <emph render="doublequote">White</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">Negro,</emph> as the American forms required (Denys Scott to Foote,

                  <p>The correspondence chiefly concerns JWT's sale of its Bucharest
							office to local manager, Hratchia Paniguian.
							 JWT's insistence upon payment in United States dollars
							complicated the transaction because it entailed the violation of
							Romanian law concerning currency exchange. Also, one of Paniguian's
							employees, Andre B. Kalman, was forced to leave Romania because of
							growing anti-Jewish sentiment, and JWT helped to arrange his safe
							passage (L.R. Coleman's letter to Foote  1-4-38, and the file titled <emph render="doublequote">International Travel,</emph>

                  <p>Several other features make the London Office Files distinctive. They
							include documents regarding the 
								1946 suicide of the senior manager of the office, Rae Smith,
							and the company's efforts to purchase his estate's extensive
							stock-holdings in JWT. One file, labeled <emph render="doublequote">Kodak, 1934-1935,</emph> contains a 17-page memo written by a Kodak
							employee to his superior, attempting to refute allegations that JWT
							violated the terms of its contract with Kodak. Another file, titled
								<emph render="doublequote">Recordings in Hollywood,
								1937-1938,</emph> relates to legal problems JWT faced in using radio
							programs and advertisements recorded in the United States for its London
							operations. Scattered throughout the London Office Files are at least
							ten letters written by JWT President Stanley Resor--most of them
							concerning the letter of terms for advertising clients and
							profit-sharing policies with key London personnel. </p>

                  <p>These files record the opening of the Mexico City
							office in 1943
							under the management of John Kuneau.  After three
							consecutive years of financial losses, he was replaced by
								Donaldson Thorburn.  Kuneau's letters to New York include
							frequent discussions of international clients such as
								Gillette, 
                     Kellogg's, 
                     RCA, and 
                        Reader's
									Digest.  Two letters to Foote ( 1-29-44 and 5-10-45) provide profiles of
							the members of the Mexico City staff, along with comments about economic
							conditions, client accounts, and advertising strategies (with special
							attention to radio programs and contests). A letter from Don E.
							Widlundth to Donaldson Thorburn ( 5-2-46) discusses an experimental run of six one-minute
							Reader's Digest films. A small glimpse into JWT's corporate culture may
							be gained from a handwritten letter by a Mrs. Bill Taylor to Sam Meek (
								11-22-47), detailing the
							hardships her family faced when her husband unexpectedly lost his job in
							Mexico City. Her outcry prompted JWT to send the family four hundred
							dollars as compensation for some of their expenses.</p>
