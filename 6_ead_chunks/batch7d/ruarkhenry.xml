         <abstract>Henry Ruark was a North Carolina Methodist minister whose sermons appeared in the Greensboro Daily News and were later published in book form. In 1960, he was minister of the First Methodist Church in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Collection chiefly contains Ruark's notes and clippings on a variety of issues and topics. Subjects include various Biblical issues, and how the church relates to secular issues such as war and racial integration. There are some reports he made to the Christian Century, as well as at least 200 sermons preached in Laurinburg, Rocky Mount, N.C. and the Duke University Chapel in Durham, N.C. There are also clippings from the Greensboro Daily News, sermons by others, and correspondence.</abstract>
