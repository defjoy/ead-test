         <abstract>F. Norman Phelps was a Chevrolet sales executive in various cities, including Milwaukee, Wisc.; Detroit, Mich., Davenport, Ia.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Los Angeles, Calif.  Full name: Fredrick Norman Phelps; b. 20 March 1895 in Bucyrus (Crawford County), Ohio; d. 23 January 1974 in Piedmont, Calif. Collection comprises a scrapbook (about 54 pgs) documenting Phelps' career as a Chevrolet sales executive. Includes primarily newspaper clippings and black-and-white photographs, although there are also such items as letters, telegrams, news releases, programs (including those for national auto exhibits, sales conventions, and other events), menus, song lyric sheets, a medallion name tag, and other ephemera, all housed in a leather "Chevrolet Sales Speeder" three-ring binder. The newspaper clippings and letters document Phelps' various transfers and promotions; other items cover topics such as  company-sponsored hunting events, meals, outings, vintage cars, and skits. There is only one unrelated item: a newspaper clipping from 1926 tells of Phelps' escape from a house fire. </abstract>
