         <abstract>The non-profit agency International Monitor Institute (IMI) operated between 1993 and 2003, primarily to assist international war-crimes tribunals by collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of international human rights law. The International Monitor Institute Records, Burma Videotapes span the dates 1992-2002, and comprise audiovisual materials related to IMI's documentation of contemporary conflicts and human rights violations in Burma (Myanmar). These audiovisual records largely document the activities, interviews, speeches, press conferences and ceremonies of political figures, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, and document the activities of political and military institutions such figures represent, including the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF), the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Records also include extensive network and independent story packages of Burma and footage of human rights conflicts. Topics and footage cover life in Burma under military regime, refugees and refugee camps (especially Karen refugees), political prisoners, survivor stories, forced labor, Japan's role in the refugee situation, and Los Angeles protests against the SLORC and Unocal. These records include copies of approximately 268 video cassettes. The video and audio material is indexed by an extensive database developed by IMI which includes keywords, air dates, segment producer, and segment title. Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive. Further organizational material on Burma can be found in the International Monitor Institute Records, also at the Rubenstein Library.</abstract>

         <p>The International Monitor Institute (IMI) was founded in 1993 by actress and film producer Pippa Scott. Scott, daughter of screenwriter Allan Scott who wrote some of the Astaire-Rogers films, was educated in California and in England, at Radcliffe College and the Southern California Institute of Architecture. Ms. Scott acted in such films as "The Searchers" and "Auntie Mame," and was a founding partner of the Emmy-award winning television company Lorimar Productions (producer of such TV hits as "The Waltons" and "Dallas" ). Scott established Linden Productions in 1987 to develop documentaries focusing on current issues. Linden's latest production is "King Leopold's Ghost," a documentary about the exploitation of the Congo by King Leopold II of Belgium. Scott was a member of the Women's Refugee Commission, the Pacific Council on Foreign Relations, and the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.</p>

         <p>The International Monitor Institute was founded in 1993 and operated until 2003. Its primary mission was to assist international war-crimes tribunals by collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of international human rights law. Videos and audio tapes were acquired through donation as well as on collecting trips by IMI associates in the former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, and other countries. IMI's activities also included developing regional archives of videos on conflict and human rights abuses, producing film and multimedia projects to assist humanitarian organizations, organizing public outreach events, conducting video research for governments, film makers, authors, and students, and providing educational outreach. Patrons and partners of IMI and its collections included the International Criminal Court and its staff, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, and former First Lady Hillary Clinton.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

                     <item>In August 1997, Aung San Suu Kyi discussed various economic and political issues taking place in Burma and the National League for Democracy (NLD): "Investment in Burma won't be a success due to instability and inflation. Dialogue is the best possible solution to the problems in Burma." She expressed the NLD's readiness for comprehensive dialogue with the government, not merely a meeting. Although Suu Kyi's movements were restricted and her speeches were not reaching the public,people could get the updates through Radio Free Asia, BBC, VOA or theDemocratic Voice of Burma. Regarding the political stalemate, Suu Kyi said, "Politics is not a drama, it is everyone's life.The regime-sponsored National convention will not bring genuine democracy because their members do not truly represent the people." When generals accused her of being a dictator in NLD, she said generals did not understand democracy.</item>

Although the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) signed the United Nations Convention on Child Abuse,they did not prevent children from working in government projects. SLORC must deliver basic family rights before it can go further.(Continue interview in Tape 4)</item>

The State Law and Order Restoration Council Council (SLORC)-sponsored anti NLD marches were not evidence of NLD's failure. People are forced to attend those rallies. General Kyaw Ba was mentioned threatening Suu Kyi on the dialogue issues. When Lee Kuan Yew commented that SLORC should be in power to prevent what had happened in Bosnia from happening in Burma, Suu Kyi said Bosnia's problem was not caused by a weak government but rather by a strong government's prolonged oppression.</item>

                     <item>The State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) open market economy does not benefit the majority. It only benefits the elite.The system is not a genuine market economy but "crony capitalism." The sanctions will not benefit the vast majority who are not also beneficiaries of market economy. The SLORC does not spend on public health, education and other development programs at all. Sanctions will force the bankrupt SLORC to the dialogue table with the National League for Democracy (NLD). The timing of this will be when there is a confirmed repression being committed by the SLORC against citizens and an opposition such as the mass arrest of NLD members and a physical attack on NLD members by the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA). Suu Kyi expressed that NLD's will is free, free from harassment and arrests of the members.</item>

                     <item>Press conference: May 1996, Suu Kyi announced that 195 elected representatives, 10 ordinary members and 12 from the youth wings were arrested so far by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in an attempt to obstruct the NLD congress. All ECs are still free. NLD intends to go ahead as planned. SLORC claimed that NLD did not enjoy popular support. Suu Kyi countered that SLORC spent a great deal ofenergy to arrest and disrupt NLD congress which is much smaller than a SLORC wedding; proof that SLORC is nervous. Sanctions won't hurt great the majority of Burmese. Investments benefit only a small fraction of population closed to SLORC who are already wealthy. Suu Kyi joked about taking military intelligence's (MI) pictures and publishing them.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Press Conference: NLD is always ready for dialogue. NLD will lead Burma toward democracy as soon as possible. Suu Kyi claimed that 1996 was the critical year for Burma's democracy. Investments can't be stopped but no profit is expected. In Burma there is no rule of law and the economy is in bad shape. It was not known how much the Japanese government had provided in humanitarian aid to Burma. Arrests and harassments have proven that SLORC is nervous about NLD. Suu Kyi was released but not free. SLORC would be happy if she leaves Burma. More arrests including Suu Kyi's arrest was anticipated. SLROC has broken promises.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Suu Kyi walked while newsmen followed. She mentioned U Win Htein's arrest and the emotional matter.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Interviews after the Congress were canceled due to road blocks in October 1996. Suu Kyi announced that a total of over 500 were detained. All those efforts were wasted due to lack of dialogue. When asked if the Burmese see no hope and no sign of change, she said people had no choice except to hope and wait and work. But people will never give up on peace and justice. She never breaks promises. SLORC gives out false information on her and NLD. SLORC does not allow her to go on out of town trips. SLORC persuades Asian diplomats not to invite her.Phone calls are intercepted. Her security is SLORC's excuse but is actually more for digging information.

                     <item>Two people interviewed by ABC, U Win Htein &amp; Eva (Maung San Hlaing) were arrested as part of the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) intimidation campaign. Suu Kyi and some National League for Democracy (NLD) members will continue to work. They know the consequences of doing so. NLD as a political party has to function as it is supposed to.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Chicago Herald Tribune's Burmese article was cut out with scissors. U Aye Win, Suu Kyi's assistant, was nowhere to be found. Some members were released. Final statistics showed over 800 were arrested nationwide. Only 20 to 30 had been charged and only 23 released. Suu Kyi said, "Too much blood has been spilled, that many have been put into jail. People have tried. What more could we do? Bloodshed before change is a wrong concept. We don't believe in violence." End Interview.</item>

                     <item>Interview on September 30 1996:SLORC released Suu Kyi. "Dialogue is the ultimate tool to solve problems in Burma. Dialogue is not a boxing match in which one will beat up the other to win. If conditions and the environment change toward an acceptable level, NLD will join the convention."</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>NLD is being marginalized due to the convention. The economy has never been good enough. 40% to 90% of the farmers are starving due to the government's export-oriented policy which forces farmers to sell crops with the government prices. Investment is never good for the public but good to the few close to SLORC. NLD has no intention to strip those who are rich due to SLORC's policy. NLD won't lead the country back to 1988. We will lead the country ahead.</item>

                     <item>Ohn Gyaw spoke: "The truth was overshadowed by the money making reports. No nation would tolerate such challenges andthey would absolutely deal with it the way we did. Changes were indeed already in place. The emergency Party Congress was held on the 23rd July 1988 when Ne Win announced his retirement and pushed for a referendum. But it was rejected. Sein Lwin was elected, but when he was unable to contain the disturbances he was replaced by Dr. Maung Maung. During those days, demonstrators caused massive destruction. Peace, order and the rule of law were challenged. Tatmadaw was the only organized and disciplined entity left in the country. It assumed power to stop the disintegration of the country."</item>

                     <item>"Demonstrators demanded a multiparty democracy to which the government agreed. But the formation of an interim government was the communist party's agenda. The slogans used by the demonstrators were communist party slogans. In the video clip communist leaders discussed taking power by turning down the interim government. The conclusion was that the people's uprising was nothing but the Communist plan to assumepower. To make the situation worse, the news agencies abroad spread rumors and fabricated reports on Burma and her government. Some human rights agencies instigated with unrelated and irrelevant issues. Force was used to protect the government property and only a handful were killed or wounded, unlike what was put in the foreign reports. Brutal beheading scenes were shown but it is stated that foreign journalists only recorded the bad things. Those beheaded, according to the mob, were the residents of the government-sponsored housing projects who were paid to poison the drinking water by Ne Win's daughter Sanda Win.</item>

So Tatmadaw is ready to sacrifice for the good of Burma. It formed SLORC and assumed power. Eventually, law and order were reinstalled. Tatmadaw successfully saved Burma.</item>

                     <item>Aung San Suu Kyi and U Aung Shwe met the journalists. Suu Kyi read the NLD press release of November 22, 1995." National Convention must be based on the foundation of democratic principles, the rule of law on basic human rights such as freedom of speech, freedom to worship, freedom of expression and association. The regime-sponsored National Convention has not operated in accordance with those principles. Delegates are hand-picked. Only 15.24% are elected. Speeches are censored. Decisions are made before presenting to the convention. There is no fixed timetable. State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) broke their words of the duty to write the constitution. It's the duty of those elected in their declaration in 1/90. NLD welcomes dialogues."</item>

                     <item>Interview: The arrests are not totally unexpected. State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) has been nervous whenever NLD makes a move, even when it is a normal political activity. The response was based on the extent of their fear. Lt. Gen Kyaw Thein's comment was that there is no need for opposition. He doesn't understand the democracy.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>The Rule of law prevents anarchy, but SLORC broke the law. They broke Section 339 and section 340, arresting people without warrant, and forcing NLD delegates to leave Rangoon. SLORC put forth a campaign against her money and her consulting with foreign powers. She was required to submit bank statements. Business people need to note that SLORC does not respect the fundamental business privacy law. The arrest of 600 did not help them get any solid evidence that NLD collaborates with foreign sources, Uncles' (U Tin Oo, U Kyi Maung) cars were often stopped. SLORC pressured the landlords to take the NLD sign off the township offices and closed down some. But we will put back as soon as possible.</item>

Hla Min was interviewed by Heather Kelly: Q: Why did you have to shut the whole college if you claimed only few students joined it (regarding the November 1996 student protest)? A: Schools were suspended based on the decision of students, parents and teachers. Students and Labor Unions cannot be allowed. SLORC is undertaking a nation building process. It goes step by step. Good time will certainly come. Every family has at least one soldier so army and people are one. Army is one big family of the people. The outside opinion is not important to SLORC. Achieving the objectives and how people value SLORC's achievements are more important. Sanction does not hit the government. Government does not care. Give SLORC another 5 years they will industrialize the country. Investments are working just fine, making changes to people of all levels. There are 9 times more cars on the streets. Cemeteries have to go. There is no exemption. They have to give way to development. Aung San Suu Kyi may continue her weekend speeches as long she keeps it in her compound. Press Conferences will continue and visa will be issued before hand.</item>

She has been freed from house arrest only one month. There is tremendous duty of continuing the struggle for freedom. For all the problems of the world, the end is when peace, security, human rights, and democracy are granted for every human being. Women must participate in politics as men do. No wars have ever started by women but most victims have been women and children. After the cold war leaders must invest on social and educational development and public health instead of wars. Tolerance is the key to peace. Ignoring is not tolerance. Understanding and appreciation are the tolerance. The relationship between men and women should not be patronage and dominance.It must be appreciation and gratitude. Women in Burma are struggling for democracy. It is time for forgiveness and reconciliation."</item>

                     <item>At her sister's suggestion, Laura Boorman, a doctor from United States, who just lost her husband and son in a robbery, took a trip to the exotic east hoping to find peace. She landed in Burma in August 1988 at the peak of the people's uprising against the military regime demanding democratic changes in the country. She was unable to leave Burma because she lost her passport. Attempting to move around town, she met her former professor, Aung Ko, now an unofficial tourist guide and they ventured out to the North. After the car broke down they were forced to stay with student activists in Prome. They exchanged ideas. Laura could not understand why a government could be so cruel to its own people. The morning came, they tried to escape to Rangoon but the army killed a student. She and Aung Ko hardly escaped the gun shots and managed to sail down to Rangoon on a bamboo raft. Rangoon was already in chaos. Troops shot and killed thousands on the streets. Unable to reach the US embassy, Laura Aung Ko and the students fled Burma on a truck and later on foot till they reached the Karen controlled area. Again under fire they successfully crossed border to Thailand. Laura decided to volunteer in the Refugee camp crammed with the wounded and the ill.</item>

On the fifth anniversary of her house arrestthere were demonstrations in front of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) embassy in London and the symbolic jailing of two British MPs attracted the world media.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Yuzana Khin was interviewed while campaigning for democracy through her show across America. "I'll struggle with her for Burma no matter how long it takes." She showed the prolonged discontent over ruthlessness and corruption of army. The 1988 uprising was caused by only a tea shop argument, the argument between students and local folks over what music to play. Army opened fire into the crowd and killed thousands. The primarily leaderless revolution found their rightful leader - Aung San Suu Kyi." As soon as I saw her face, for some reason I knew she is the one we have been looking for (Yuzana Khin)." Aung San Suu Kyi was only 2 when her father was assassinated. But she studied his past.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>(Prof. Josef Silverstein): Aung San Suu Kyi raised two children as a Buddhist. A shin Byu scene - In September 1988, when SLORC took power and promised election, National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi was formed. She covered campaign trails by plane, by boat, and by train, reaching everyone. The message was the same: democracy. People welcome her tremendously. Army harassed her campaign constantly and finally SLORC locked her up. Congressmen Bill Richardson visited the prisoners and Aung San Suu Kyi.Furniture was scarce because she sold it in order to eat. It did look like a prison.National League for Democracy (NLD) won landslide victory over rivals including the SLORC backed National Unity Party. Army not only did not honor the promise but stepped up the crackdown on the elected NLD members and insisted on their version ofNational Convention. Elected MPs were either jailed or intimidated. Some escaped and managed to put up parallel government in Washington DC. Dr. Sein Win, acting Prime Minister of National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) said: "The West is not doing enough. "Hollywood shot a movie called "Beyond Rangoon" about this story.</item>

                     <item>Scenes from Burma, narrated by Aung San Suu Kyi: Democracy is people's will, not the will of leaders who want to rule with absolute power. Democracy is people's involvement in politics. That was how the 1988 people's upraising took place in Burma.People were fed up. They needed only a spark to start the full blown revolution. That uprising was cracked down. She knew the right time had come. National League for Democracy (NLD) was formed for the election. Aung San Suu Kyi's name was magic. State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) started to disrupt her and finally kept her under house arrest. In spite of all kind of oppression, NLD won the election. SLORC ignored the results and jailed the MPs. When released in 1995 she began the gate speeches. Fear was the most destructive factor in Burma.</item>
                     
                     
                     <item>Suu Kyi said she was honored to receive this award on behalf of everyone who struggled for democracy in Burma and the people of Burma. Human rights abuses did not decline. They worsened instead. NLD had been harassed. Many working committees were forced to close. With help of the people who love peace and justice and the relentless will of the people to be free we will achieve our goal.</item>

                     <item>In the name of border area development and in an attempt to boost the trade ties with neighboring Thailand, Junta crushed the rebellion of Karen minorities and civilians. Naw Htoo, 26 years old, fled Burma when her family was forcibly relocated to Myitta village. They left their own village, leaving everything behind. They were settled but given no food allowance. Soldiers took them as porters. Her domestic animals were taken by soldiers when starvation struck them. Her husband's brother and father ventured back to the village they abandoned to harvest rice in order to feed them. Soldiers caught them and shot them after torturing them. Naw Htoo fled to Thailand and worked hard, but Thai soldiers often harassed her. Naw Tha's family escaped to Thailand but her husband died of tuberculosis. Her husband was never treated before.</item>

                     <item>After Karen National Union (KNU) split with the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) in 1995,their headquarters fell. In the next two years, army advanced, forced tens of thousands of villagers to flee Burma. Army forcibly relocated the villagers, clearing the whole area.Those relocated villages became labor pool for army. Those who escaped to Thailand were put in the camps near border. In the January 1997 New Year celebration at Mae La camp, the DKBA, with the help of Burma army, executed a series of cross border raids, and burned and killed the refugees. Thai Army refused to do anything.The KNU 4th Brigade commander, "Oliver,"was interviewed. KNU with All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) abandoned the fixed camp warfare and adopted guerrilla warfare. Thai army turned away male refugees. Many were still trapped in the Burma side of jungle. Soldiers were ordered to kill anyone who tried to flee or returned to the village to collect food they left behind. Refugees had to live on roadsides and everywhere. Rumors of not being accepted by Thai authority scared away hundreds. They went back to the malaria-infested jungles. There was no medicine and not enough food.</item>

All this needs forced labor because there is no other way the government can get this done.And we do not have the kind of machinery that will enable us to get these kind of projects going quickly. So it's human power that they need, man power, forced labor power"; International Labor Organization (ILO) Report: "Workers were not paid or compensated in any way for providing their labor, other than in exceptional circumstances...and were commonly subjected to various forms of verbal and physical abuse, including rape, torture, and killing"; Unidentified woman(working on road): "The biggest fine is 500 Kyat. If we don't dig a ditch or canal, we pay 500 Kyat. What can we do? We're poor. It's a daily struggle to get food. Now we're here, we have to do this forced labor.

There is no Rule of Law in Burma. We should appeal to the international community to take greater interest in the restoration of democracy in Burma. NLD wrote to State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) about five instances of human rights violations. Two duties of NLD: protest lawlessness of SLORC and implementation of UN Resolution.Concrete steps should be taken to fulfill people's will. Economic progress can not be guaranteed without the rule of law. We have called trying to establish dialogues but SLORC chose to ignore. The situation in Burma is threatening regional stability.</item>

                     <item>Human rights pertain to all human beings. Those who are repressed are not the same as those who are free. The case of Burma is not only concerned with Burma but is representative of the suffering of people around the world.UN resolutions on Burma, in place since 1989, have never been implemented. The resolution must be implemented. The SPDC tried to intimidate the Burmese people, but has never tried for a genuine dialogue. We don't enjoy basic rights. The Burmese people are being deprived ofbasic human rights. The National League for Democracy (NLD) is subjected to severe repression. The regime created economic and political chaos, with the result that millions crossed into neighboring countries. Ethnic minorities are being targeted by the regime and they have fled into Thailand by the tens of thousands. I beg neighboring countries to extend humanitarian help to the refugees. The UN resolution on Burma is clear. Help any way you can to enable the UN resolution to be implemented.</item>

Malaria is the main admission, as well as HIV and Tuberculosis. The patient number is growing. We have different units to treat different patients. There are more migrant workers now. Sixty others help in the clinic. Most deaths were caused by malaria, infection, malnutrition and violence.Public education is now extended.</item>

My parents showed me what is going on in my country. 1988 my sisters were arrested and I took part since June 1988. I was associated with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I kept underground since 1988 until 1997. People support democracy. I have to hide whenever they search. I received a lot of help from people. Working inside Burma is much meaningful. The problems: Lack of communication. Lack of space.</item>

"One can pay to be free, but most of us are very poor. We do not have money to pay." "If I refuse to work I'll be detained and fined." "State Law and Order Restoration Council never pay any money to people." "Women have to work the same work load as men.If they cannot finish the work on time, the authority will give more tasks as punishment." "If they escape they will be kicked and punched." "People from the cities are asked to contribute money for the construction." "Forced porterage is a serious issue. Porters carry artillery shells and food. They are given little food and have to work as mine sweepers."</item>

I stayed abroad, I am married to a foreigner, but it is wrong to think that due to such circumstances my love for Burma is less than anyone else. Our family knew the best how hard my father worked. I joined the uprising because this is the affair of the whole country. Being Bo Gyuke's daughter, I could not just sit back home. We can call this upraising the second struggle for independence based on the will of the people. Always united. Unity is the key for democracy. Discipline, peace is important. Students are fine and courageous and have shown physical strength. Hope to see their metal strength. No one is behind the students. Pure desire to gain democracy. I never support the political opportunists. We have already tried some. We need to try more.</item>

I served several positions and placesin KNU. We do not kill prisoners of war. This is the biggest difference from State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) army. We allow him to defect or send him home. Burmese army rapes the female captives but we never do that. We are brothers not enemies. We must be different from enemy otherwisewe do not need to fight. My youngest brother died in the war. I sought revenge in blood. In a decisive victory I had my revenge. I realized that I had killed my brothers. I thought it was not the solution.</item>
