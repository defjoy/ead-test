         <abstract>Abortion rights activist. Director, Southern Tier Women's Services in upstate New York. Former President of the Abortion Conversation Project; founder and past president of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. Collection comprises primarily printed materials that document Johnston's work as an activist at the national level. Includes the abortion provider newsletter Feminist Caucus News (1989-1991), which later became Networks (1992-1998 and undated). In addition, there are copies of Johnston's counseling aids, including the workbooks Abortion: Which Method is Right for Me?; Pregnant? Need Help? Pregnancy Options Workbook; and A Guide to Emotional and Spiritual Resolution After an Abortion. There are order forms, advertising, and occasional publications associated with the workbooks and other items offered for sale; an article pro-choice political activism for the 1996 elections; a few letters, notes, and memos by Johnston, including two undated pages with her notes on the material's historical significance. Also includes a copy of Morgen Goodroe's Abortion Resolution Workbook, greeting cards, Religious Groups for Choice ephemera, and other abortion counseling information. </abstract>
