         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>Formed in 1986, the South Africa Policy Implementation Committee pursued the policies formulated by the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock and agreed to by the Board of Trustees.  In 1985, University President Terry Sanford created the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock.  The Committee was chaired by Law School professor Walter Dellinger, III, and composed of four students, graduate and undergraduate, six faculty members, two administrators, and two Trustees.</p>
         
         <p>On May 3, 1986 the Board of Trustees, at the recommendation of the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock, voted to sell all holdings of companies doing business in South Africa if that nation's system of apartheid was not ended by January 1, 1987.</p>
         
         <p>The Board's vote in support of divestment followed more than a year of campus activism focusing on apartheid and University investments in South Africa.</p>
