         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Mirecourt House, established ca. 1975 is an independent co-educational, social-selective residence hall for Duke University undergraduate students in their junior and senior years. Some of Mirecourt House's programs have included a ropes course, tutoring at the Salvation Army, karaoke, and a variety of themed parties.  Mirecourt is governed by a House Council elected by members of the group.</p>
            
            <p>Mirecourt is located in Craven Quad of the West Campus of Duke University. In the 1970s, Mirecourt House was part of the Association of Independent Houses. In the 1980s, Mirecourt became part of the Edens Federation.  The Edens Federation was established to represent interests of undergraduate residents of Duke University who lived on West Campus in Mirecourt House, Taylor House, Burton House, Lancaster House, Tabard House, and York House. In 1982, the Delta Tau Delta fraternity attempted to move in and fill three floors of the house, causing protest among house members. </p>
            
            <p>Mirecourt House participates in Rush and attracts about 300-500 rushees to fill 10-30 spots. The house is currently co-ed and social-selective. </p>
