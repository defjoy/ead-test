         <abstract>Collection comprises a handwritten copy of the Gazette (11 pgs, handstitched), plus an envelope. The Gazette contained a personal and detailed account of the marriage of Charlotte Elizabeth Octavia Collinson (1817-1850) to Charles Stansfield Rawson (1812-1863). The writer of the account was unidentified, but was probably one of Collinson's sisters. There are sections on the bridesmaids, ceremony, cake, wedding breakfast, and other celebrations, as well as desciptions of various family members. Rawson lived at Nether Wasdale, Cumberland, and married Charlotte at Boldon Church on Feb. 18, 1840. Later, two of their sons went to Queensland, where they made a fortune in ranching and pioneered the settlement of Mckay. The envelope, postmarked 1895, is illustrated and addressed to E. Rawson, Imperial Hotel, Brisbane, Queensland. </abstract>
