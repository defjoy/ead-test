         <p>Lucius Aurelius Bigelow was born in Boston,
		  Massachusetts on January 31, 1892 to Lucius Aurelius and
		  Mary Elizabeth Bigelow. He graduated from Boston English
		  High and from there went to Massachusetts Institute of
		  Technology where he received his S.B. in 1915. He attended
		  Harvard from 1916 to 1917 and then went to Yale as a Howard
		  Fellow from 1918 to 1919, leaving with a Ph.D. in organic
		  chemistry. He began his teaching career at St. Lawrence
		  University but only stayed a short time until moving to
		  Brown University, where he taught for nine years. In 1929
		  Bigelow came to Duke University where he served as a member
		  of the chemistry department faculty until 1961. Bigelow's
		  primary field of research was fluorine chemistry and the
		  direct fluorination of organic compounds. His research
		  provided the foundations for the preparation of
		  fluorocarbons by direct fluorination carried out during
		  World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. After
		  retiring from active teaching at Duke, he continued his
		  research work at Hynes Chemical Research, a firm started by
		  several of his former graduate students. In 1958 he was the
		  recipient of the Herty Medal by the Georgia Section of the
		  American Chemical Society, recognizing him as an
		  outstanding Southern chemist. Lucius A. Bigelow died in
		  1973, survived by his wife Mary Cummings Bigelow and two
		  children.</p>

               <p>This series consists of material relating to
				the personal life of Lucius A. Bigelow and includes
				biographical information, correspondence, and photographs.
				The correspondence contains letters to both Lucius and his
				wife Mary, discussing family and health matters. These
				include an interesting letter to Mary from her sister,
				regarding missionary work in South Africa as well as a
				Woman's Christian Temperance Union speaking tour through
				local schools extolling the "Value of Raisins". The
				photograph album in this series is of particular interest.
				It contains photos of chemistry faculty from both Brown and
				Duke universities during the 1920's, including Paul Gross,
				J. H. Saylor, and C. H. Hauser. It also has several
				interesting photos of the campus and Durham, including the
				construction of the chemistry building. The photographs
				folder contains photographic portraits of Dr. Bigelow. This
				series also includes a short memoir by Bigelow entitled
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Memorable Things Happening
				to a University and College Teacher of Organic Chemistry in
				the Course of a Lifetime</title>. The memoir is
			 professional in nature, relating lessons both taught and
			 learned during his over forty years as a teacher.</p>

               <p>The correspondence consists chiefly of letters
				relating to students and about their research work, letters
				of recommendation, letters to colleagues in academe and
				industry, and letters regarding the publishing of scholarly
				papers. Bigelow's role as mentor and teacher and his
				relationships with his graduate students are particularly
				well revealed throughout the course of this correspondence.
				He was tireless in his work to secure good jobs for his
				graduates. Of particular note are letters describing two
				explosions that happened in the chemistry laboratories, one
				in 1931 and another in 1954. Another interesting series of
				letters describes Bigelow's attempts to aid one of his
				graduate students, who happened to be Japanese, right on
				the eve and in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. Names of his
				professional correspondents include chemists such as Henry
				Gilman, William A. Noyes, H. S. Booth, and Arthur Lamb.
				These letters are chiefly regarding research questions
				relating to his work with fluorine. </p>

               <p>This series contains material related to the
				Department of Chemistry at Duke. It includes student
				papers, quizzes and examinations, some syllabi, and lab
				procedures for classes taught by Bigelow. The bulk of the
				course material relates to Chemistry 151 and 152. The
				research council material details grants given to Bigelow
				for research and assistants. Finally, this series contains
				an article written for the Journal of Chemical Education by
				Bigelow, Warren Vosburgh, and John Saylor entitled
				"Chemical Education in American Institutions-Duke
				University." It is an excellent source for the early
				history of the department.</p>

               <p>This series and subseries contain papers and
				reports regarding Dr. Bigelow's research in organic
				chemistry. The earliest work is his thesis from MIT,
				whereas the majority of the articles and papers document
				his continuing series of papers on "The Action of
				Elementary Fluorine Upon Organic Compounds." Most of the
				papers are co-written with his doctoral students. The
				series also contains his entry on fluorine for the
				Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
