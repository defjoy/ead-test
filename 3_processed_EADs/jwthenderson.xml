         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Howard Henderson, a J. Walter Thompson Co. advertising
		  executive, span the years 1867 to 1978, although the bulk of the material dates
		  from 1954 to 1960. The collection documents the history of the J. Walter
		  Thompson Company (JWT). In particular it illustrates changes in the company's
		  advertising philosophy through 1960; JWT's marketing strategies (especially the
		  use of new findings in the fields of psychology, sociology, and anthropology);
		  historical company and client relationships; structural relations and internal
		  policies; analyses of advertising media; the company's adaptation to the
		  changed business situation during World War II; and the career of Henderson and
		  his deep personal involvement with clients, colleagues, and contacts outside of
		  advertising. The material consists of correspondence, office files, memoranda,
		  notes, account histories, advertisements, reports, charts, scripts, clippings,
		  and printed materials. Clients represented include Andrew Jergens,
		  Chesebrough-Pond's (1930s and 1940s especially), Eastman Kodak International,
		  General Cigar, U.S. Playing Card Company (1930s and 1940s especially), NATO,
		  Union Central Life Insurance, Arbuckle, U.S. Brewers Foundation, and Standard
		  Brands (Fleischmann Yeast).</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr">Correspondence Series</ref>
		  contains an extensive collection of letters relating to both personal and
		  business matters. Most of the correspondents have some connection to JWT,
		  either as employees or as clients, and they include William Groom, Axel Hornos,
		  Arno Johnson, Stanley Resor, Norman Strouse, James Webb Young, and John B.
		  Watson. The correspondence discloses reservations about the expansion of
		  consumer culture and advertising's role in it in the late 1950s; discusses
		  advertising as a vehicle for public benefit;, and evaluates new market
		  strategies.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="clie">Clients Series</ref> contains
		  material on accounts that Henderson worked on and illustrates the special
		  interest he took in his clients' success. Especially well-documented clients
		  include the Chesebrough-Pond's, U.S. Playing Card Company, General Cigar, and
		  Union Central Life Insurance Company accounts. This series documents JWT's
		  client relationships, the clients' products, specific campaigns, and JWT's
		  methods of acquiring new clients.</p>
         
         <p>The large
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="spec">Special Projects Series</ref>
		  comprises files that Henderson created when he began working for JWT half-time
		  and mostly out of his home. Because of the diverse nature of these files, the
		  series is organized into eight subseries. The first of these is the J. Walter
		  Thompson Company Study Subseries, which contains the research materials
		  Henderson collected for a study and survey of JWT's history. Henderson
		  originally designed his study to acquaint JWT employees with the roots of the
		  company and to pinpoint the sources of its basic strengths; however, it evolved
		  to include practical answers to specific conceptual and organizational issues.
		  Other well-documented topics include JWT's use of case studies; N. W. Ayer and
		  Son advertising agency; advertising strategies in the 1940s; development of the
		  JWT Consumer Panel; concerns with house advertising; information on the New
		  York Office, Detroit Office, and London Office; and London's Rowntree account.
		  Also included in this subseries are cables and letters that discuss sending the
		  London Office staff members' children to the US during the bombing in 1940. The
		  Case History Project Subseries complements the J. Walter Thompson Company Study
		  Subseries and includes copies of resulting case histories and some source
		  materials for the histories. Accounts studied for this project include Pan
		  American Airlines, Chesebrough-Ponds, Foundation for Commercial Banks, General
		  Cigar Company, Standard Brands, U.S. Brewers Foundation, U.S. Playing Card Co.,
		  and various coffee and tea accounts. The case histories detail successful
		  strategies that Stanley Resor and Henderson hoped would prove effective also
		  for other accounts.</p>
         
         <p>The Eastman Kodak International Advertising Subseries in the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="spec"> Special Projects Series</ref>
		  consists of materials generated during Henderson's business trip to research
		  improvements for the international Kodak campaign. Henderson also used this
		  trip to investigate prospects for securing individual European Kodak accounts
		  for JWT's international offices. The subseries includes business correspondence
		  relating to the trip, personal correspondence with Eastman Kodak personnel, and
		  an Eastman Kodak clippings file. A report on his trip to Europe documents
		  company thinking on the need to coordinate and to unify Kodak advertising in
		  all of Western Europe. The Copy Seminar Study Subseries contains materials
		  Henderson generated while investigating the effectiveness of JWT's Copy
		  Seminar. JWT's Copy Seminar was designed to teach staff members about copy
		  writing. Briefly covered in the series is the existence of a Women's Copy Study
		  Group designed specifically to promote copy writing talent among the company's
		  women staff. The subseries includes Henderson's findings and recommendations
		  along with memoranda relating to the purpose and process of the study. The
		  Personnel Department Subseries provides insight into J. Walter Thompson's
		  recruiting and hiring philosophy, especially as it regards gender. The material
		  highlights J. Walter Thompson's early recognition of the importance of women's
		  contributions to advertising. In general, the material collected in this series
		  emphasizes the company's desire to attract the best talent from the country's
		  colleges, shows the intense competition for the few openings each year at J.
		  Walter Thompson, and documents contemporary recruiting policy.</p>
         
         <p>The Trade and Technical Department Study Subseries of the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="spec"> Special Projects Series</ref>
		  consists of material on finances, statistics, organization, and policies of the
		  Department. The primary orientation of the materials is toward improving the
		  effectiveness of the Department. The comparatively low percentage of
		  advertising to the retail trade and ways to increase the company's profits in
		  this area are also revealed in this subseries. The International Offices and
		  Special Assignments for Sam Meek Subseries covers a variety of subjects, most
		  of which are related to J. Walter Thompson's international operations during
		  the time Sam Meek headed the International Division. Subjects include taxes on
		  national and international advertising, the use of television advertising
		  overseas, international visitors to the New York Office, international offices'
		  policy letters, advertising for NATO, fund raising for Johns Hopkins
		  University's School for Advanced International Studies, information on a
		  campaign for the Citizens' Committee to Keep N.Y.C. Clean, and JWT's research
		  procedures and general policy letters. The New Business Presentations Subseries
		  contains material on the company's administrative and departmental structure
		  and provides insight into JWT's procedures for securing new accounts.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="cinc">Cincinnati Office Series</ref>
		  documents the early activities of the JWT office as well as Henderson's
		  transfer to the New York Office and his appointment as Vice President. </p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="clip">Clippings Series</ref> relates to
		  JWT, its employees and clients, and indicates how thoroughly Henderson involved
		  himself with the life of the company.</p>
