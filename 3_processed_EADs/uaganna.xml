         <bioghist>
            
            <p>William Trigg Gannaway was born in Wythe County, Virginia in 1826.  He graduated from Emory and Henry College in Bristol, Tennessee in 1847.  In the autumn of that year, he opened a high school at Floyd Court House, Virginia. He conducted this school for a few years when he was elected head of a high school at Germanton, North Carolina.  He ran this school until he was appointed Professor of Latin and History at Trinity College in Randolph County, North Carolina in 1857.  In the absence of Braxton Craven, Gannaway served as President of the college from 1863-1865.  He remained at Trinity College until it moved to Durham in 1892, when he retired from teaching.  After retiring, he kept his home and farm in Randolph County.  He died in 1911.

            <p>The collection largely includes grade books and account books. These consist of personal account books (Gannaway, like many other teachers, was also a working farmer) and college account books.  They have not been separated.  The is a report to the Trustees from 1864 as well as miscellaneous memoranda, receipts, financial records and notes, and a small amount of correspondence, including a letter from E. F. Finch in 1888 that concerns the financial affairs of Charles Heitman and their effects on Trinity College. The material ranges in date from 1853-1906.
