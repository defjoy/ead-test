         <p>The Duke-UNC Center for Research on Women (CROW)
		  was founded in 1982 as a collaborative endeavor between
		  Duke University and the University of North Carolina at
		  Chapel Hill to promote Women's Studies scholarship,
		  research, and curriculum development in the South. With
		  support from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller
		  Foundation, smaller grants from local foundations, and
		  institutional backing from both Duke and UNC-CH, the Center
		  aimed to create a network among scholars and others in the
		  region who were interested in the new scholarship on
		  women.</p>
         
         <p> The Center's regular activities included a
		  post-doctoral humanist-in-residence fellowship program; the
		  publication of a working papers series:
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Southern Women: The
		  Intersection of Race Class and Gender</title>, a joint
		effort with the Memphis State University Center for
		Research on Women; the publication of a biannual
		newsletter,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Branches</title>, which
		informed scholars and other interested individuals in the
		region about conferences, job opportunities, grants and the
		new scholarship on women; and a wide range of conferences,
		seminars and community events. </p>
         
         <p>The Center also sponsored statewide and regional
		  conferences on topics such as Pay Equity in North Carolina,
		  Women and Work in the South, and Dialogues Between Black
		  and White Women. Other activities included high school and
		  college curriculum transformation projects, including the
		  Ford funded project,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Incorporating Women of Color
		  Into the Undergraduate Curriculum</title>; women's studies
		summer institutes; the 1988 annual Southeastern Women's
		Studies Association (SEWSA) meeting; and the 1991 Southern
		Association of Women Historians Conference. From 1985-1990
		the Research Center was home to
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Signs: A Journal of Women in
		  Culture and Society</title>, one of the leading feminist
		scholarly journals in the country. The central purpose of
		the Center was to underline the dynamics of gender, race,
		and class as central themes upon which to base
		understanding of women's and men's experiences in the
		South. </p>
         
         <p> The Center's Advisory Board included both Duke
		  and UNC-CH faculty: Dorothy Browne (School of Public
		  Health, UNC); William H. Chafe (History, Duke); Peter
		  Filene (History, UNC); Barbara Harris (Women's
		  Studies/History, UNC); Iris Hill ( Center for Documentary
		  Studies, Duke); Soyini Madison (Speech Communications,
		  UNC); Micheline Malson (Inst. for Public Policy, Duke);
		  Jean O'Barr (Women's Studies, Duke); Margaret O'Connor
		  (English, UNC); Angela O'Rand (Sociology, Duke); Naomi
		  Quinn (Anthropology, Duke); Janice Radway (Literature,
		  Duke); Anne Firor Scott (History, Duke); Jacquelyn Dowd
		  Hall (History, UNC) was the Academic Director and Christina
		  Greene was the Project Director. </p>
         
         <p> The Center's primary projects included:
		  <list type="marked">
               
               <item>Curriculum Transformation: grants from the
				Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation to work with
				faculty in the region to create or revise courses in the
				humanities and social sciences to reflect the new
				scholarship in women's studies with particular attention to
				issues of race and class. The Center's first Ford grant in
				1982 provided support for the Duke and UNC-CH Women's
				Studies Program Directors to develop the Introduction to
				Women's Studies Course on each campus. In 1989-1992, Ford
				funded the project
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Incorporating Women of
				  Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum</title> to work
				with Duke and UNC-CH faculty in four target departments:
				History, English, Sociology and Anthropology.</item>
               
               <item>Research: Ford provided funding in 1982 for
				11 faculty and 28 graduate students from Duke and UNC-CH
				whose work addressed the Center's focus on gender, race and
				class.</item>
               
               <item>
                  
                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Signs: A Journal of
				  Women in Culture and Society</title>: In 1985, the Center
				won a national competition to become the host (1985-1991)
				to the leading scholarly feminist journal. Many of the
				Center's Advisory Board members served as editors for the
				journal. </item>
               
               <item>Rockefeller Humanist-In-Residence
				Fellowship Program: From 1987-1992, the Center received
				grants from the Rockefeller Foundation to bring scholars to
				the Center for a year to work on a book-length manuscript
				on race, class, and gender. These funds provided support
				for 11 scholars (mostly junior scholars), all of whom were
				able to turn dissertations into books or make substantial
				progress on completing a second book.</item>
               
               <item>What Difference Does Difference Make: The
				Politics of Race, Class, and Gender: Ford and Rockefeller
				Foundation grants provided funds for a national conference
				to explore the state of the current scholarship on
				diversity. The conference, held May 1992, brought together
				scholars in women's, racial, ethnic and critical legal
				studies to explore some of the current debates surrounding
				work on diversity, including the controversies over
				"political correctness" and multiculturalism, affirmative
				action and the Columbus quincentennial.</item>
               
               <item>Pay Equity in North Carolina: The Center
				received funding from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation to
				promote pay equity (based on gender and race equity) in
				North Carolina through a statewide conference and a pay
				equity study/project which would serve as a model for
				similar efforts throughout the state. The Center completed
				the second phase of the project in the fall of 1992, and
				Orange County became the first public entity in North
				Carolina to conduct a pay equity study and make pay
				adjustments in accordance with its findings.</item>
               
               <item>Visiting Lectureship Series: (funded
