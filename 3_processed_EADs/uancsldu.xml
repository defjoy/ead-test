            <p>The North Carolina Student Legislature, the oldest active student legislature in the United States, was established in 1937. The organization represents North Carolina universities, colleges, and community colleges and offers students practical experience in politics and the legislative process. Under the leadership of a central government, member school delegations study current issues, write bills, and present resolutions for presentations at statewide meetings. The Student Governor and staff carry out all procedures at statewide meetings, which include delegates from all institutions with North Carolina Student Legislature chapters. Bills passed at annual statewide meetings are made available to the members of the North Carolina General Assembly.</p>
            
            <p>
The Duke University chapter has won several awards for best legislation, best bill, and best delegation. The 1979 Annual Session was hosted at Duke University. As of 2003, the Duke University chapter of the North Carolina Student Legislature is not active.
