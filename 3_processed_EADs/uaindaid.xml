         <abstract>Independent Aid, Inc. was the first charitable foundation established by Doris Duke, daughter of businessman and philanthropist James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke. It was incorporated in Delaware in October, 1934. Although Miss Duke had limited direct involvement with Independent Aid, its disbursements reflected her persistent interests in the welfare of women and children, education, social work and mental health, and early family planning efforts. The foundation’s daily operations were administered largely by Marian Paschal, who served as Secretary until her death in 1946, and by her successor, Georgea T. Furst. Independent Aid, Inc. became the Doris Duke Foundation in 1951.
 The collection spans the years 1934 to 1954, beginning with the establishment of Independent Aid, Inc. and including administrative entries through the first years of the Doris Duke Foundation. Journals, cashbooks, ledgers, and minute books comprise the majority of the collection; these detail contributions to the foundation as well as disbursements. The remaining materials include correspondence, the foundation’s original by-laws, federal tax forms, financial records and lists of stock holdings, and memoranda documenting daily operations.

         <p>Independent Aid, Inc. was the first charitable foundation established by Doris Duke, daughter of businessman and philanthropist James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke. It was incorporated in Delaware in October, 1934, shortly after Miss Duke turned 21 years of age. The foundation’s daily operations were administered largely by Marian Paschal, who served as Secretary until her death in 1946, and by her successor, Georgea T. Furst. Although Miss Duke had limited direct involvement with Independent Aid, its disbursements reflected her persistent interests in the welfare of women and children, social work and mental health, and early family planning efforts; recipients included the Center for Self-Supporting Women and Students of New York City, the Mental Hygiene Association, and the Child Adoption and Placement Bureau among many others. Additionally, many individuals received funds either to sustain them through financial difficulties or as educational loans and scholarships. In October, 1951, the officers of Independent Aid, Inc. voted to change its name to the Doris Duke Foundation.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
