            <p>There was already some arrangement to the collection when it came to
			 Duke University, and this is reflected in the choice of series maintained. The
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Topical Series,</title>
		  Subseries II, was created at Duke out of the many slides that arrived unsorted.
		  Product categories in this subseries are those used by the industry itself. A
		  few subgroups within
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Topical Series,</title>
		  Subseries I are labeled <emph render="doublequote">Miscellaneous.</emph> Some
		  of these miscellaneous groups are extensive and should not be overlooked in a
		  comprehensive search.</p>
            
            <p>The collection contains a few negatives and loose transparencies,
			 especially in the
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Award Nominees Series.</title>
		  These were sleeved and interfiled with the
		  slides. Information from most of the
		  slides in the collection was entered into the
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Resource for Outdoor Advertising
			 Description (ROAD)</title> database (available in early 2003). An "SL" number
		  was assigned to an individual slide and placed on the slide itself, while also
		  being used as the database record number. Certain letter combinations are
		  restricted to certain series, but they do not necessarily <emph render="italic">match</emph> the first letter of a corresponding series or
		  subseries. Approximate dates found on
		  slides were usually included in the database,
		  but many dates could not be confirmed. Gaps were left in some slide sleeves to
		  show divisions between groups of
		  slides that originally were banded or boxed
		  together. Older boxlists with old notebook designations may also be found in
		  this repository. Old slide notebook designations were maintained on the new
		  slide sleeves and in the
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">ROAD</title> database. Box
		  number prefixes (e.g. CH, TP) indicate particular series except in the case of
		  the small series at the end of the collection, all placed together in boxes
		  labeled "TT1" and "TT2."</p>

         <p> The Outdoor Advertising Association of America Slide Library was
		  created by officials in the
		  Outdoor Advertising Association of America (
		  OAAA) and member organizations.
		  OAAA is the primary professional and trade
		  association representing the
		  outdoor advertising industry, and was founded to
		  promote
		  outdoor advertising interests in the U.S.
		  OAAA members own and operate
		  billboards, 
            street furniture, transit, or other
		  outdoor advertising displays. Members also include
		  service providers to the industry, users of the outdoor medium and others
		  supporting its goals.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Association of
		  America Slide Library</title> spans the years
		<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1891/1999" type="inclusive">1891 through the 1990s,</unitdate> with the bulk of the
		collection originating in the
		<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950/1959" type="inclusive">1950s</unitdate> and later. The collection documents over a
		hundred years of
		outdoor advertising primarily in the
		United States, plus some international campaigns
		from several other continents. The
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Slide Library</title> is a large
		collection, almost entirely comprised of
		slides of
		billboards, exhibiting a grand range of graphic
		artistry,
		advertising campaigns, and marketing strategies. A
		smaller group of images supports the
		ad collection with views of artwork,
		billboard construction and other related images. In
		addition to over 62,000
		slides, there are a few early
		glass slides,  as well as
		transparencies, a small number of paper files, and
		six
		audiocassettes accompanying slide presentations.
		Many images were submitted by
		outdoor advertising companies over a number of years
		to the
		Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) as
		entries in annual national competitions to determine the best poster designs.
		The OAAA currently sponsors the OBIE Awards, which were preceded by awards
		programs under various names and sponsorships starting in the early 1930s. The
		award is modeled after the ancient Egyptian obelisk, considered by many the
		earliest form of
		outdoor advertising. Indeed much of the collection can
		be seen as evidence of this awards program although only the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Award Nominees Series</title>
		contains slides labeled as such. Other slides probably were transferred to OAAA
		when companies cleaned out their back files, though the precise sources of many
		items are unknown. The slides were maintained at
		OAAA primarily as a large supply of creative
		examples for member companies. Researchers interested in the following subjects
		may find the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Association of
		  America Slide Library</title> especially helpful: the
		outdoor advertising medium itself,
		advertising awards, 
            advertising design, 
            billboard construction,  and
		commercial art, as well as the many
		outdoor advertising companies, 
            advertisers, and
		advertising campaigns represented.</p>
         
         <p>The images, designed to attract mass audiences, depict part of
		  American society's history - a history of consumer attitudes and desires. The
		  collection is therefore a valuable tool in formulating not only a pictorial
		  development of the
		  outdoor advertising industry but of societal norms
		  and opinions. The
		  ads speak to the creativity of artists and
		  designers, but they also convey a rich story of how these creators saw society
		  at large, especially in the
		  United States. Perhaps more importantly,
		  ads reveal how corporations and designers felt
		  America <emph render="italic">wanted to see itself.</emph> Such visual richness
		  underlies the primary goals of selling goods and services and promoting ideas
		  for the public good. There are thousands of product
		  advertisements but also many
		  public service ads, 
            political issue ads, and even Happy Birthday
		  greetings in the collection. Billboards are one direct link from corporate
		  America, various interest groups, and their advertising specialists
		  <emph render="italic">to</emph> consumers; and a succinct one-sided
		  conversation designed to spur them to action. </p>
         
         <p>In contrast to other types of
		  advertising, 
            outdoor ads were designed with the fast-moving
		  traveler in mind. The collection documents well the evolution of the
		  billboard's attempt to reach those on the move, especially drivers. With
		  careful thought to what would quickly provoke interest,
		  advertisers presented a huge range of thought from
		  text-free images of abstract artwork to direct discourse (e.g. Vote for Nixon).
		  Because posters were displayed for only limited time periods, and because their
		  physical size makes them impractical to store, photography is the primary
		  method of capturing billboard images. Most billboard photos - whether print or
		  slide - were created to document the work of the company which posted them for
		  their business use. </p>
         
         <p>Within the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Slide Library,</title> the
		creative output of many
		outdoor advertising companies is documented, although
		particular creators of many of the ads are unknown.
		Foster and Kleiser is well represented in the
		collection. Other companies named in the collection include
		Naegele, 
            Pacific, 
            Turner, 
            Eller, 
            Donnelly, 
            Columbus, 
            General Outdoor, 
            Patrick, 
            Gannett, 
            Lamar, 
            United,  and many others. Thousands of national
		campaigns are represented, but many local
		ads are present as well. Outdoor formats range from
		19th century posters to <emph render="doublequote">multi-vision</emph> boards
		that automatically change views with the use of three-sided boards. Most images
		are of actual
		billboards, 
            posters, and other outdoor advertising formats in the
		field, while a sizable portion are just images of the ad design itself with a
		plain background. There are some slides of
		stock posters (<emph render="doublequote">Your brand
		name here</emph>) and other forms of outdoor advertising such as
		bus cards, 
            street furniture, and
		truck side advertising. The vast majority of the
		advertisements are in English. </p>
         
         <p>The first three series make up the bulk of the collection: the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Award Nominees Series,</title> the

		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Chronological Series,</title> and
		the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Topical Series</title> (by far the
		largest of the three). These series are made up almost completely of
		slides showing
		advertisements, usually in billboard format. All
		series are described further within the container list. The only other series
		with a sizable number of advertisements is the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">International Posters
		  Series.</title> This is where the largest concentration of
		international ads is found, although there are a few
		scattered within the other main series.
		Ads may also be found scattered throughout the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Presentations and Presentation
		  Slides Series.</title>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>Several additional small series contain images of related content,
		  providing support and context to the
		  advertisements. These include the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Construction and Creation
		  Series,</title> the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Artwork Series,</title> the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Street Scenes and Approaches
		  Series,</title> and the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Other Outdoor Advertising Related
		  Images Series.</title> The
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Presentations and Presentation
		  Slides Series</title> adds insight by showing some of the internal conversation
		between directors and trainees,
		advertisers and advertising creators, and more. </p>
         
         <p>The most direct route to locate any identified ad is through the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Resource for Outdoor Advertising
		  Description (ROAD)</title> database, available in early 2003. Information about
		most
		slides in the collection has been added to this
		database. Researchers will be able to search for specific attributes of ads
		such as brand or company name, product type, and headline, as well as other
		types of information including slide number, date, collection name, image type,
		image color, outdoor advertising type, and special notes. Many database records
		also contain a searchable field with the outdoor advertising company's name
		(posting company), a field indicating if the billboard is in a rural or urban
		setting, information on the presence of women, children, ethnic individuals, or
		famous people in the ad, and the billboard's geographic location. Various slide
		series were entered into the database differently. Multiple searches may be
		required for comprehensive searching. For more information, consult Research
		Services Staff (special-collections@duke.edu).</p>

		  collection's Physical Structure Series, and Photographs, Slides, and Negatives
		  Series. Closely related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library include the John Brennan Outdoor Advertising Survey
		  Reports, the John Paver Papers, the John Browning Papers, the Duplex

		  Campaigns, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America Records, the Outdoor
		  Advertising Poster Design Collection, the Garrett Orr Papers, the R.C. Maxwell

               <p>These
				slides (labeled with "SLA" prefix) were
				submitted to the
				Outdoor Advertising Association of America
				  (OAAA) specifically as nominees for the national award program, most
				recently known as the
				OBIE awards. Member companies and advertisers
				submitted what they felt to be their best work for this national competition.
				The first National Contest and Exhibit of Outdoor Advertising Art was presented
				by the Outdoor Advertising Department of the Ad Council of the Chicago
				Association of Commerce in 1930. Later, sponsorship appears to have been
				provided by the Art Directors Club of Chicago, and perhaps other industry
				organizations. The Institute of Outdoor Advertising (IOA) was involved starting
				in 1965 until its merger with the
				OAAA, which continues "the OBIE" awards
				competition today. The OBIE award is patterned from the ancient Egyptian
				<emph render="doublequote">obelisk,</emph> considered by many to be the
				earliest form of outdoor advertising. Award categories varied by year but early
				groupings often included
				Posters, 
                  Painted Bulletins, Campaigns, and Public Service
				(Kerwin H. Fulton medal award). Later, the number of categories grew to include
				emerging formats such as
				transit advertising and product type categories.
				</p>
               
               <p> The competition has been known by a variety of names in the
				collection including the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">National
				Competition,</title> the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Outdoor Advertising
				Competition,</title> and later, the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">OBIEs.</title> Winners
			 were published in a serial, issued also under several different names:
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Advertising
				Outdoors,</title>
                  
                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">100 Best Posters,</title>

                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Outdoor Annual,</title>

                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Outdoor Advertising
				Competition,</title> and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">OBIE Awards</title> (consult
			 Duke's online catalog). These publications indicate that
			 ads posted in one calendar year were usually
			 eligible for the award presented the following year (recent winners can be
			 found on OAAA's website: www.oaaa.org). Unfortunately, labeling within the
			 collection and publications was unclear as to whether a specified year is a
			 posting date or an award year. Years given in the list below are taken from
			 original slide sleeves and containers. For more information on national outdoor

			 advertising awards, consult the publications
			 listed above, the online catalog, and Rubenstein Library Research Services Staff.</p>
               
               <p>While a sizable series, only a relatively small portion of many
				decades of national competition nominees are represented here. It has not been
				determined with certainty whether the outdoor industry sponsored any awards
				from 1973 to 1982, but the OBIE award was not awarded during that time. This
				may explain most of the gap in slides from 1969 through 1982. Some
				transparencies also are included in this series. Labeled yellow slips were
				found attached to original slide sleeves, perhaps referring to slides removed
				at one point. Information on these slips was transferred to acid-free paper and
				clipped to the new archival sleeve. Some images are marked as being winners in
				a particular category, but most slides or sleeves have no such marking. Old
				notebook designations (A-1, A-2...) were maintained on the slide sleeves. Old
				notebooks were listed in the preliminary boxlist as follows: A-1: 33rd-35th
				National Competition (1965-1967); A-2: 1984; A-3: 1984; A-4: 1985; A-5: 1985;
				A-6: 1986; A-7: 1986; A-8: 1986; A-9: 1987; A-10: 1987; A-11: 1987; A-12:
				Various Designs and Awards. Hard copies of old boxlists may be found in this
				repository's inventory drawers.</p>
               
               <p>Slides are arranged by award competition dates and were numbered
				in that order, all with the prefix "SLA." In this series only, slides inserted
				after most had already been numbered were assigned a number with an
				alphabetical suffix so all slides following would not have to be
				renumbered.</p>

               <p>The Chronological Series slides ("SLD" and "SLG" slides) are
				roughly in chronological order within each box. The earlier images have a
				higher concentration of
				poster advertisements as opposed to
				billboards. The series is almost completely made
				up of advertisement slides, but there are also some street scenes and a few
				other slides that could be tied to a specific era.<lb/>

               <p>The Topical Series is the largest group of advertisement slides in
				the collection and is organized by product or service type. It has been
				maintained in two separate but similar subseries, the second being the larger
				of the two. To provide meaningful organizational categories for sometimes vague
				products, issues, and services, each category within each subseries is in
				effect one of three things, (1) a product type (food, cars, etc.), (2) a
				sponsoring organization (armed forces, liquor stores, etc.), or (3) an ad type
				(public service, political ads, etc.). Read through the entire list to target a
				search before browsing through boxes.
				Advertisements are often arranged into subgroups
				and then alphabetically by brand name within the groups listed below. For the
				second subseries, see category descriptions appended to this document before
				searching. A large percentage of the slides are undated but range from at least

				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1940/1988" type="inclusive">1940 through 1988.</unitdate> There are probably earlier
				images in this series as well that could not be dated precisely.<lb/>

               <p>Presumably, some of the ads in this series ("SLM" slides) were
				submitted for an International category of the OBIE awards program, a category
				added in more recent years. They are often in a smaller poster format to
				accommodate larger pedestrian audiences abroad. Some products featured include
				alcoholic beverages, concerts, cheese, travel, London transportation,
				beverages, museum exhibitions, festivals, ice cream, newspapers, and the Moscow
				Olympics. The slides are arranged by slide number.</p>

               <p>This small series ("SLE" slides) provides perhaps the most context
				for the creative process. More than just the finished product, these slide
				images show ads at every stage of creation from idea boards to finishing
				touches. Most slides show images of people working on billboards, but there are
				also graphics showing billboard dimensions or various billboard types, photo
				images of workrooms, workers at worktables, workers with equipment doing actual
				construction, cranes hanging large billboard segments, photos of props used to
				put together an image, shots of billboards at various stages of completion,
				close shots of trim pieces, and more. The slides are arranged by slide
				number.</p>

               <p>This series ("SLH" slides) contains slides with images of street
				scenes, often showing long approaches to billboard sites. There are examples of
				outdoor advertising present, but views are from a distance. These images were
				used in planning and preparation for construction or to show sites to
				prospective clients. This series reveals the most outdoor context of time and
				place for the advertising. While most shots in other series are close-ups of
				billboards, these photo images almost always show a wider scene. Slides are
				arranged by slide number.</p>

				did not easily fit into other categories. It includes slides of the 1975
				Miss America and other campaigns designed to
				test or prove how well people could remember information from the outdoor
				medium. Various pieces of art are included, as well as a mock-up of a

			 publication cover; photographs related to a consumer survey; group
			 portraits from industry meetings, some from as
			 early as the 1910s; print advertisements; and portraits of advertising
			 executives including
			 Burr Robbins. Slides are arranged by slide
			 number.</p>

               <p>This series contains slides organized for individual
				presentations, several with
				scripts included. The presentations at the
				start of the series are the most complete. As the list continues, the
				presentations become less complete (e.g. lacking slides, transcripts, etc.),
				until only loose slides from presentations are present. The intact
				presentations at the start of the series
				were created for a variety of audiences by outdoor executives often as training
				devices or sales tools for prospective clients. A number of the presentations
				were put together by the
				Institute of Outdoor Advertising, the
				marketing arm of the industry. The
				scripts and slides provide a mix of
				information not found in other series, including an introduction to the medium,
				comparisons to other
				advertising media, and history of the
				industry.</p>
               
               <p>Included are some historical images from the early days of outdoor
				advertising, but the series mostly contains mid to late 20th century images
				including
				billboard construction; shots of the creative
				process; labeled charts indicating the standard billboard sizes; statistics on
				cost,
				reach, 
                  frequency, and
				readership; and much more information about the
				medium in general. Though not indexed in the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">ROAD</title> database, there
			 are many images of outdoor advertising used as examples in the presentations.
			 Some slides relate to specific companies or campaigns such as
			 Kraft, specific markets such as Birmingham, or
			 certain product types such as insurance or magazines. Many of the loose slides
			 are grouped into at least partial presentations. Three of the scripted
			 presentations have
			 audiocassette recordings included in box PR13.
			 There are duplicate slides in some presentations and so presumably, many were
			 created and used in various presentations according to the need at the time.
			 For database control purposes, individual "SLB" numbers were assigned to whole
			 presentations.</p>

         <head>Category Descriptions for Topical Series - Subseries II</head>
         
         <p>Though seemingly well-defined on paper, the fluidity of these
		  categories becomes obvious when facing thousands of diverse and often vague
		  advertisements. If an initial search in one category does not bear fruit, try a
		  related category. The best way to find any particular advertisement is via the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">ROAD</title> database, available
		in early 2003. In cases where more than one product was featured in an ad,
		usually the most prominent item dictated category placement. </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Amusement and Entertainment</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for the following:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="italic">Bars, Casinos, Concerts, Country Clubs, Live
		  productions (e.g. theater), Lotteries, Museums, Motion pictures, Movies, Night
		  clubs, Race tracks, Sporting events, Teams (sports), Theaters, Theme parks,
		  Venues (concert or event venues), Zoos.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>Generally, advertisements for hotels, resorts, national parks, and
		  whole geographic areas ("See Florida!") as tourist destinations were placed in
		  Transportation and Travel (T and T), but there is overlap with T and T. Look in
		  both categories for a comprehensive search. Products in the Amusement and
		  Entertainment category are generally final destinations, as opposed to means of
		  travel. Most
		  television show advertisements were placed in the
		  Media category since the network was most often a prominent part of the
		  advertisement, but some may also be found here. Most recordings can be found in
		  the Consumer Goods and Services category.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Apparel</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for the following:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="italic">Clothing brands, Fashion accessories, Footwear
		  (shoes), Jewelry</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>If searching for a particular apparel brand name, search this category
		  along with "Retail," as it was often difficult to tell if a name on a billboard
		  referred to a brand of clothing or an entire clothing store. Zippers were
		  usually placed in the Consumer Goods category. Ads for watches may be found in
		  Apparel or Consumer Goods and Services.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Automotive</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for the following:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="italic">Auto parts, Auto parts stores, Auto service,
		  Auto dealers, Auto leasing, Auto manufacturers, Motor oil, Motorcycles,
		  Motorcycle products, RVs, Tires, Tractors</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes advertisements for almost anything related to
		  cars, except gasoline. Auto parts stores are usually included here, not under
		  Retail. Gasoline and gas stations were placed under Transportation and Travel
		  (T and T). Ads showing both motor oil and gasoline (and/or car service) were
		  put in the category of the item most prominent. A search for all gas stations
		  should be completed in both this category and T and T. Often an ad advertised
		  both car products and gasoline, or just the brand name was presented (Texaco -
		  provides oil, gas, and car service). Sometimes it was unclear whether an ad was
		  for an automotive or a household radiator and so both the Automotive and
		  Consumer Goods and Services categories should be checked for those items. To
		  search for a particular car dealer, look through subgroups of that dealer?s
		  manufacturer within this category.</p>

         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for the following:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="italic">Alcoholic beverages, Non-alcoholic

         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages
		  including mixers, coffee, buttermilk, and milk. Evaporated milk is most often
		  found in the Food and Restaurants category. For a comprehensive search of all
		  beverages, also check the Food and Restaurants category.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Business and Technology</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>This category includes ads for the following:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="italic">Agricultural products, Armed forces, Banks,

		  Schools, Software, Telecommunications, Telemarketing firms, Utilities </emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>General office supplies usually went into the Consumer Goods and
		  Services category. Flooring and wallpaper (as well as other items used both by
		  builders and average consumers) should be searched both in this category and in
		  Consumer Goods and Services. Ads for lotteries can usually be found within the
		  Amusement and Entertainment category. Car dealer financing is usually found in
		  the Automotive category. Outdoor advertising is usually found in the Media
		  category. Many ads featuring major appliances are without a brand name - these
		  are probably for a utility company and were placed here. For this reason,
		  however, some utility-sponsored ads may also be found in the Consumer Goods
		  category. Search both this category and Consumer Goods for animal feed.
		  Government-sponsored ads can be found in this category but if sponsorship was
		  questionable, ads may have been put into Public Service, Consumer Goods, or
		  some other category according to the nature of the ad. This category contains
		  the largest variety of materials. Check other categories to complete a
		  comprehensive search. Schools were sometimes put into the Public Services

            <emph render="italic">Appliances, Books, Cemeteries, Dry cleaners,

         </p>
         
         <p>Household products include zippers, most flooring, and wallpaper.
		  Office supplies were placed here but other office products are in Business and
		  Technology. Services were also placed here including funeral homes, and dry
		  cleaners. Cable Service ads can usually be found in the Media category. Search
		  for watches in this and the Apparel category. Cars, motor oil, car-related
		  products, RVs, and motorcycles can be found mostly in the Automotive category.
		  Gasoline can be found in the Transportation and Travel category. Sometimes it
		  was unclear whether an ad was for an automotive or a household radiator and so
		  both the Automotive and Consumer Goods and Services categories should be
		  checked for those items.</p>

         <p>Gum, pet food, and tobacco products were most often placed in Consumer
		  Goods and Services, although some may still be found here. Beverages, including
		  coffee and milk, can usually be found in their own Beverages category.
		  Grocery store and supermarket ads are usually found
		  within the Retail category.</p>

         <p>Ads for recordings (albums, CDs, etc.) and books were usually placed

         <p>This category includes advertising created for a charitable cause or
		  by a non-profit organization. Government organizations are normally listed
		  under Business and Technology, but government sponsorship of an ad was often
		  difficult to discern. Check this category and Business and Technology for a
		  more comprehensive search.
		  Political campaign and issue ads can usually be
		  found here. Some Public Service-type ads were actually placed under the
		  sponsor?s usual category, if the sponsor?s name was an obvious part of the ad.
		  For instance an ad saying <emph render="doublequote">Don't Drink and Drive,
		  courtesy of Fred's Funerals</emph> may have been placed under Consumer Goods
		  and Services. Schools were sometimes put into the Public Service category as a
		  non-profit and sometimes placed in Business and Technology.</p>

            <emph render="italic">Convenience stores, Department stores, Discount

		  Shopping centers, Variety stores</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>Some ads featuring clothing lines may have been placed here by mistake
		  since it was often difficult to tell whether a name referred to the clothing
		  brand or a store name. Some of these ads also feature an individual product or
		  products carried by the retail store. If the item seemed prominent in the ad,
		  the slide may have been indexed under Consumer Goods or Food and Restaurants.
		  For auto parts store ads, search this category as well as the Automotive
		  category.</p>

		  search both this and the Automotive category for an ad featuring a company that
		  sold gas and provided auto service. This category also overlaps a great deal
		  with the Amusement and Entertainment category - search both categories for a
		  comprehensive search.</p>
