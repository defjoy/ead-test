         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Volunteers for Youth, a national organization among colleges and universities, was started in 1969 at Stanford University. The Stanford Youth Program matched student athletes with junior high school-aged youth in the area.  Youth received companionship and guidance from student athletes; students reported reaping personal rewards as well. In 1975, due to the overall success, former Stanford participants expanded the program to colleges and universities across the United States. Chapters were independently governed, and by 1977, some had failed because there was no national leadership. The National Collegiate Athletic Association agreed to sponsor Volunteers for Youth and funded four directors and staff members to serve chapters. The NCAA continued sponsorship through the mid-1980s. Individual colleges and universities sponsored programs from then on.</p>
            
            <p>The Duke University program was established around 1979. Student athletes were paired with local middle school students, serving as role models for local children by taking them on outings and helping them in school. Some of the activities coordinated by the Duke University Volunteers for Youth were basketball clinics, picnics, film festivals, football games, and concerts. Volunteers for Youth was governed by 8-10 student directors, several advisors from Duke University and the city of Durham, and middle school counselors. When the NCAA discontinued sponsorship in the mid-1980s, the Duke University chapter offered volunteer opportunities to non-athletes.</p>
            
            <p>As of 2003, Volunteers for Youth is affiliated with the Duke University Community Service Center, and provides volunteer opportunities for employees and students.
