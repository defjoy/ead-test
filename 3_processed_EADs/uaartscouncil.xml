         <p>Formed around 1950, the Duke University Arts
		  Council planned music and art events on Duke's campus, such
		  as concerts and exhibits. It also created a lending library
		  of musical recordings and art reproductions, and it
		  produced a radio program, "Arts Council on the Air."
		  Membership on the Council was open to all, including
		  students; faculty, administrators, and their spouses made
		  up the leadership of the council.</p>
         
         <p>In September 1960, the Arts Council became
		  inactive, but an Executive Committee met periodically to
		  manage the funds that had accumulated during the Council's
		  active years. After a decade of inactivity, the Arts
		  Council Executive Committee proposed that the funds be
		  divided equally between the Department of Art and the
		  Department of Music, and that the Arts Council should be
		  dissolved in 1970.</p>
