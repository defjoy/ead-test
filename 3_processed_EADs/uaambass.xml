         <bioghist>
            
            <p>The Duke Ambassadors were an independent, student run, thirteen piece dance band founded by Sonny Burke '37 that was a staple of the Duke University social scene for thirty years.  They were fixtures at the "Sunday Night Sings" in Baldwin Auditorium leading the students in group sings like "follow the bouncing ball," and audience participation events like "So you want to be a Band Leader."  </p>
            
            <p>The Duke Ambassadors also had a presence off-campus traveling to locations such as Tantilla Gardens in Virginia Beach, Palisades Park in New Jersey, and even to Reykjavik, Iceland.  At the outbreak of the United States involvement in WWII the music halted while men signed up and were called up to promote the war effort.  The first post war performance of the Duke Ambassadors found them back at a "Sunday Night Sing" on East Campus in 1947. </p>
            
            <p>During the 1950s at the request of the U.S. State Department the Duke Ambassadors made several overseas appearances in places such as the Azores, Bermuda, and Panama.  They were also a fixture during this time throughout North Carolina performing annually at the Governor's Ball, and at Fort Bragg, Cherry Point Naval Base, as well as at nearly every college and university in the region.  The Duke Ambassadors disbanded in 1964. Band leaders included Sonny Burke '37, Vince Courtney (killed in WWII), Sammy Fletcher '47, James "Benny" Steele '53, and William R. "Bill" Pape, Jr. '57.   </p>
