               <p>Accession (2007-0072) houses a series of 224 black and white photographic prints depicting Hispanic American youth roller blade and street culture in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, shot by Cianni during the 1990s and into 2001. Many of the prints appear in Cianni's book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">We Skate Hardcore: Photographs from Brooklyn's South Side</title> (2001), and a number of prints are unpublished. Photographs are captioned and signed on the back. Also included are photographs of urban life in the Bronx, NY; and from the baby shower in Queens, NY, and the wedding in Fairborn, Ohio of a young couple who appear in other images from this series. Finally, the series houses the maquette for Cianni's book (version 1, 2000), and the printer's dummy (versions 2-3, 2001-2004).</p>
               
               <p>Accession (2008-0303) contains twenty-three 8x10 duotone and gelatin silver prints from Cianni's book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">We Skate Hardcore</title>, and includes portraits and other images of Hispanic American youth roller blade culture in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, during the mid-1990s.</p>
               
               <p>Accession (2010-0187) includes forty-seven 8x10 black and white gelatin silver prints from the We Skate Hardcore series. The prints are signed on verso and date 1995-2003, with bulk dates 1995-1997.</p>
