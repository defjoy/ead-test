         <abstract>Josiah Trent (1914-1948) was a thoracic surgeon, Duke Medical Center faculty member, historian, and rare book and manuscripts collector. The Trent History of Medicine Manuscripts Collection is an artificial collection made up of 780 manuscript collections with a focus on the history of medicine or medical practice in the United States and Europe. The collections were acquired by physician and rare book and manuscripts collector Dr. Josiah Trent of Duke University. The collections range in date from a possible 1588 date to 1994, with the bulk dating from the 1750s-1980s; most consist of 1-10 items, but some are larger, up to 395 items.  They are almost all correspondence collections of well-known physicians and surgeons, political figures, educators, and scientists.  Some also contain reports, engravings, clippings, data, notes, invitations, and other materials.  Topics range widely, and include diseases such as yellow fever and smallpox, treatments and vaccines, women's medicine, mental health and psychology, and the formation of the medical profession and its educational institutions.  Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Josiah Trent was a thoracic surgeon, Duke Medical Center faculty member, historian, and collector of rare book and manuscripts dealing with the history of medicine and medical practice. Many of these purchases were made from Henry and Ida Schuman, rare book dealers based in Detroit, then in New York City, with whom Josiah Trent would form a long friendship. Trent was born in August 1914 in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Trent received his Bachelor's degree from Duke University, completing his B.A. studies in three years, and entered the University of Pennsylvania Medical School medical school at age 19, graduating in 1938. He married Mary Duke Biddle in 1939. During their ten years of marriage they had four children. In those same years, besides his career as a surgeon, Trent gave lectures on the history of medicine, was chairman of the Duke Hospital Library Committee and served on the executive committee of the Friends of the Library At Duke University.  He was also an Honorary Consultant of ate Army Medical Library.</p>
         
         <p>Dr. Trent died at an early age from lympho-sarcoma in 1948. A few years later, his widow, Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans,  presented the Duke Medical Center Library with the Josiah C. Trent Collection on the History of Medicine. At the time of his death, his library contained nearly 4,000 volumes and thousands of manuscripts, including the collection of rare and unique history of medicine manuscripts described in this finding aid.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Trent History of Medicine Manuscripts Collection is an artificial collection made up of 780 manuscript collections with a focus on the history of medicine or medical practices.  The collections were acquired by surgeon, historian, and rare book and manuscripts collector Dr. Josiah Trent of Duke University.  The collections range in date from a possible 1588 date to 1994, with the bulk representing the 19th and 20th centuries; most consist of 1-10 items, but some are larger, up to 395 items.  They were often purchased by Trent for their autograph value as well as for their historical content.  They are almost all correspondence collections, but many also contain enclosed reports, clippings, data, notes, invitations, engravings, and other materials.</p>
         
         <p>Correspondents include many well-known physicians and surgeons, political figures, educators, and scientists, with an emphasis on physicians and scientists from the United States, France, England, Italy, and Germany.  Among the most notable individuals are: Abigail and John Adams; Elizabeth Blackwell; Daniel Drake; Benjamin Franklin; Oliver Wendell Holmes; Alexander von Humboldt; Thomas Jefferson; Howard Atwood Kelly; Alexander Marcet; Silas Weir Mitchell; Florence Nightingale; Sir William Osler; Louis Pasteur; Frank Lester Pleadwell; Earle Pliny; John Ridlon; Benjamin Rush; Viscount John Jervis St. Vincent; Sir James Young Simpson; Lyman Spalding; Mary Edwards Walker; and Benjamin Waterhouse. </p>
         
         <p>Topics range widely, and include epidiemology, with a focus on yellow fever, cholera, cancer, and smallpox; treatments and vaccines; history of surgery and anesthesia; the new fields of neurology, pulmonology, and cardiology; gynecology and women's health topics; mental health and psychology; pharmacology; medical publishing and research; military medicine during the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I, and other conflicts; the formation of the medical profession and its educational institutions; and the personal affairs of the individuals represented in the papers. Childhood diseases and pediatrics are not common themes but there are a few references to them, notably Abigail Adams discussion of vaccinating children against smallpox.</p>
         
         <p>The 781 small collections individually listed in this finding aid are also cataloged individually as separate collections in the Duke Libraries online catalog, but are physically housed together as the Trent History of Medicine Manuscripts Collection.  Entries are arranged alphabetically by author/creator and include the chief author of the material, date range, number of items, and a brief summary of the content. Abbreviations used include ALS: Autograph Letter Signed (hand-written and signed by same individual); ANS: Autograph Note, Signed; and TLS: Typed Letter Signed.</p>

                  <p>Virginia-born physician who graduated from Jefferson Medical College in 1857 and went to Syria to practice medicine there from 1859-1866; also studied and taught at the University of Pennsylvania.  Then resided in Hillsboro Ala., where he was a cotton planter and physician; died Nov. 19, 1876.  Papers consist of several letters to Barclay, printed matriculation cards from Jefferson Medical College (in one Barclay is referred to as being from the state of Jerusalem, Palestine), a phrenological chart, a printed speech by a James Barclay to Congress (a relative?), and various notices. One letter, written in 1857 by prominent physician Robley Dunglison, is in support of his appointment as physician at Philadelphia Hospital.  Also includes a letter to "Dr. Blackler" at the American Mission at the City of Jerusalem, undated, apparently accompanying two sample bottles of "Ayer's Cherry Pectoral." A letter from 1941 gives biographical details about Dr. Barclay. A portrait of Dr. Barclay is also held in the History of Medicine Collections Picture File at Duke, and his diplomas are housed separately.</p>

                  <p>DS. De Fere, writing as "le Secrétaire de Milice" requests that Louveaux sign and return three attached statements of health. Verso of document bears an undated draft of a letter by an unidentified physician, who, in spite of patient's consent, refuses to comply with a medical insurance company's request for the patient's medical history. The writer cites "le loi du secret médical" as upheld by "l'Association générale des médecins de France", which prohibits the release of patients' medical histories to medical insurance companies.

                  <p>Humanitarian, remembered for her work in ameliorating the condition of the mentally ill and as superintendent of women nurses during the Civil War. In a holograph, unsigned, ca. May 1862, Dix lists recommendations for promotions in the US Army hospital administration. This bears an autograph note, signed by Abraham Lincoln, forwarding the list for consideration to Secretary of War Stanton. Dix writes in 1880 to a friend concerning her physical health and in an undated note regarding a mentally ill patient. Papers also include a poem, presumably in Dix's hand, on nursing the mentally ill. This is to be found on the same sheet with the printed poem, "Stanzas", written by a patient in the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane.

Other material relates to Ehrmann in his capacity as military physician. An autograph certificate, signed by Ehrmann, protests the treatment of the French dead, citing his own futile efforts to obtain a death certificate for a French grenadier. This document was promptly returned, accompanied by a note from his supervisor informing him that it could not be submitted to the minister in its present form.

                  <p>Maryland physician and ethnologist. Letters (ALS). William Stump Forwood was a Maryland physician who attempted to justify slavery on medical grounds.  This body of correspondence, almost exclusively letters to Forwood and written immediately before and during the early part of the Civil War, relates to questions of race, e.g. "the Negro problem", intermarriage and consanguinity. The mechanics of editing and publishing a medical journal also form a topic of discussion. Principal correspondents are Samuel Worcester Butler and Washington Chew Van Bibber. Other correspondents are Sylvester David Willard, John H. Van Evrie, J. P. Evans, Joseph Leidy, S. M. Bemiss, James A. Bayard, and Samuel A. Cartwright. Additional Forwood papers are held by UNC-Chapel Hill (1600 items).

                  <p>Physician and naturalist of Massachusetts.
Letters (ALS). Gould writes of his life as tutor to the family of Mr. McBlair, a wealthy manufacturer of Jericho, Maryland, in long, detailed letters to his father, Nathaniel Duren Gould. In the earlier letters, he describes the trip from Boston, the roads and landscape, and presents a pencil drawing of the McBlair house and surrounding buildings. He writes of the day's routine, his teaching duties, and neighborhood news and gossip. He tells of how he listens for the mail wagon and of his disappointment with his pupils. His letters show that he did manage to keep up with events beyond Jericho, especially in the New England area. In his later letters, he professes a growing interest in medicine and botany. A much later letter informs William Jenks of his election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

                  <p>Surgeon and anatomist.
Letters (ALS). Loder writes of his situation and that of friends and family during the Napoleonic Wars, from Narva in 1806 and from Moscow in 1813. In the first letter, he bemoans the defeat of the German states; mentions the student unrest at the University of Halle and the subsequent closing of the university as yet another setback for the German nation; and sees Russia as the only "nation" which can now hope to defeat Napoleon. Loder, educated in Germany, was born in Riga, Estonia, and thus could be considered a Russian. In the second letter, he expresses fierce Russian nationalist sentiments, for which uncharacteristic effusions he explains that he cannot give reasons in writing. Probably he meant to appease the Russian censors. In this letter he details his efforts to organize and oversee the operation of the field hospital in Kassimoff and describes Moscow before and after the siege.

                  <p>Swiss-born physician and chemist, educated at Edinburgh and served at Guy's Hospital in London. Collection of letters, chiefly to Marcet, the majority of which originate with Dr. John Yelloly (1774-1842), physician. Yelloly discusses the Royal Medical and Chirurgical societies at length, comments on Marcet's chemistry work, and congratulates Marcet on his appointment to the military hospital at Plymouth, and later on his appointment as honorary professor of chemistry at Geneva; he also mentions Marcet's wife's own published work on chemistry. Ten letters are from Sir Charles Blagden, and mention Berthollet, Banks, Thomas Young, and Prevost. There are seven letters from Sir Henry Holland asking about the use of Elaterium in cases of dropsy, and twelve letters from Thomas Young (1773-1829), discussing his professional plans, and a paper by Prevost. Includes a letter written in French whose references to Waterhouse and Jenner signal the writer's involvement in the promotion of vaccination.

Puente submits two recipes which he has found to be effective in the alleviation of yellow fever and asks that his findings be reported to the U.S. Consuls in Mexico and the Antilles and to the authorities in Vera Cruz, Havana and Philadelphia.

                  <p>Dutch physician; personal physician and advisor to Empress Maria Theresa.  Note (ANS). Reviews A. M. Salvini's Italian translation of Xenophon of Ephesus, "Di Senofonte Efesio degli Amori di Abrocome e d'Anzia", sent to the Empress Maria Theresa by the Chancellery of Hungary. Condemns the essay appended to the second edition of the volume, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Cicalata sopra una certa curiosa statuetta,</title> as "tresí impudique". Note is evidence of Swieten's function as censor to the Empress' library. A typed transcript and an English translation are available.
