         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Collection contains an unpublished manuscript of 
		<title xlink:type="simple">A Photorealist in Quest of God</title> by McCurdy. This work
		traces the artistic development of his son, John. Among the correspondence are
		letters between John and his parents, and diaries detailing the early lives of
		both John and his sister, Ann. Also included is an exhibition catalog of John's
		work (1977); an essay by John with publishers' responses; his doctoral
		dissertation; reprints of articles John wrote; original art work; legal papers,
		handwritten notes, printed material, yearbooks, course work, diplomas,
		correspondence; and slides and photographs. Other works by Harold McCurdy
		include 
		<title xlink:type="simple">Barbara, The Unconscious Autobiography of a Child Genius</title>
		and 
		<title xlink:type="simple">About Mary.</title> Another group of materials include
		correspondence, clippings, articles, and other items relating to Harold
		McCurdy's writing, teaching, and publishing career.</p>
         
         <p>Addition (2000-0424) (8216 items, dating from 1918-1999) provides a relatively
		  well-rounded and sometimes intimate look into McCurdy's personal and
		  professional life over the majority of his lifetime. Materials include
		  correspondence from and to McCurdy; writings on psychology, poetry, and drama;
		  diaries; subject files; cartoons; and 254 color slides of paintings and other
		  sketches and writings by McCurdy's son, John Derrickson McCurdy.</p>
         
         <p>Addition (2009-0021) (8 items; 0.2 lin. ft.; 1949-2006) consists of 6 bound notebooks and diaries kept by McCurdy. Some of the diaries appear to be sequential; other notebooks include clippings and writings. There is also an index of McCurdy's submissions (1949-1998), as well as a compilation of his poetry (2006).</p>
