         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>SPUD (Student Project for University Development)
		  was a student-run service organization dedicated to
		  including students in the planning and development of Duke
		  University. SPUD was founded in 1976 by James Paulette, a
		  Duke University undergraduate. SPUD was governed by leaders
		  from a variety of student groups on campus. </p>
         
         <p>With a loan of $500 from the Office of
		  Institutional Advancement and a $100 gift from the Nursing
		  School's student government, SPUD began planning its
		  fundraising activities for 1977. SPUD worked in cooperation
		  with Alumni Affairs and the Office of Institutional
		  Advancement (now University Development). In August 1977,
		  the Office of Institutional Advancement announced a $1.5
		  million grant from the Kresge Foundation for the University
		  Center; the grant was credited to SPUD's general enthusiasm
		  and creativity. </p>
         
         <p>The three main projects that SPUD sought to fund
		  were the Duke University Center, the East Campus Activity
		  Center, and the Reggie Howard Memorial Scholarship Fund.
		  The University Center was to be a new meeting place for
		  students; the East Campus Activity Center would replace an
		  extremely small gymnasium. The scholarship, named for a
		  much-admired member of SPUD's Executive Committee, was
		  intended to help minority students attend college. Both the
		  University Center and the Reggie Howard Memorial
		  Scholarship projects were completed. Some of SPUD's
		  fundraising activities included art sales, a bench-a-thon
		  (fraternity men sitting on a bench for 101 hours),
		  swim-a-thons (numerous laps by the Neridians, Duke
		  University's synchronized swimming team), raffles for dates
		  with sorority women, backrub sales, radio ad sales,
		  concerts, tennis tournaments, selling discount cards, and
		  distribution of coupon booklets.</p>
         
         <p>SPUD dissolved in 1979 and was replaced by SCIAAA
		  (Student Committee for Institutional Advancement and Alumni
		  Affairs), formerly a subcommittee of SPUD. SCIAAA worked
		  with the Office of Institutional Advancement (now
		  University Development) to continue to raise funds. SCIAAA
		  primarily focused on meeting with alumni and potential
		  donors to provide a current perspective on student life at
		  Duke University. </p>
