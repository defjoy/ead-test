         <p>The Committee on Facilities and Environment (CFE) was formed by President Brodie in 1986 after consultation with the Academic Council.  The CFE combined the Educational Facilities Committee and the Chancellor's Environmental Concerns Committee.  The committee is advisory to the President and the senior officers on "all relevant issues relating to the campus or areas contiguous to campus."  It reviews the administration's recommendations to the Trustee's Building and Grounds Committee.  CFE is composed of six faculty and six administrators, and is co-chaired by one faculty member and one administrator.  Members are appointed by the President for three year terms.  The Committee meets twice a month, provided there is business to conduct.    </p>
