         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Alfred Paul Tischendorf was born June 12, 1929 in Painesville, Ohio to Mr. and Mrs. E. W. Tischendorf.  He received his B.A., summa cum laude, from Kent State University in 1950.  In 1952, he was awarded his M.A. with honors by the University of Chicago where he also received his PhD degree in 1957.</p>
            
            <p>
Dr. Tischendorf came to Duke in 1955 and served as Assistant Professor in the Department of History.   During the 1953-54 academic year, he studied in England under provisions of a Rotary International Fellowship awarded to him. In 1957, he studied in Mexico City.  His publications include "The Anglo-Mexican Claims Commission, 1884-1895," "The Loss of British Commercial Pre-eminence in Mexico, 1876-1911," and "British Experience in Georgia, 1865-1907."
</p>
            
            <p>
Dr. Tischendorf died unexpectedly from hepatitis in November, 1962 while on sabbatical in Argentina. His Argentine studies on 20th century Argentine politics were made possible by a grant from the Joint Committee on Latin American Studies of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies.
