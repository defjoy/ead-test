         <abstract>Walter B. Gibson (1897-1985) was a professional magician and author, who often wrote under the name Maxwell Grant, and is credited with defining and popularizing the pulp hero, The Shadow. The collection includes: Two Shadow story outlines, one from 1943 and another from 1980, which was Gibson's last Shadow story; 97 radio scripts from Strange, a seemingly lost 15-minute program that Gibson hosted in 1955; an unproduced television proposal, Mike Regan, Confidential Investigator, circa the mid 1950s; and two bookplates featuring a black and white image of The Shadow.</abstract>

         <p>Walter B. Gibson (1897-1985) was a professional magician and author, who often wrote under the name Maxwell Grant, and is credited with defining and popularizing the pulp hero, The Shadow. The character started as the narrator for the radio show, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Detective Story Hour</title>, but became so popular that he inspired his own magazine. Gibson was hired to write the pulp which he did with staggering frequency, producing 282 of the 325 Shadow pulp novels, starting with the character's debut in 1931 and ending in the late 1940s. Years later Gibson published three final Shadow novels, including what would be his last story, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Blackmail Bay</title>, in 1980. Gibson wrote for a wide variety of publications and other mediums including television and film, but often as a ghost writer. Today he is primarily know for The Shadow, which spawned numerous imitators, Batman being the most notable.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
