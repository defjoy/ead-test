         <abstract>Bernard Lafferty was hired as Doris Duke's butler in 1987 and he remained in that position until her death in 1993. In her will Doris Duke named Bernard Lafferty as the executor of her estate and for a brief period of time he was President of the Doris Duke Foundation. After a lengthy trial disputing the provisions of the will, Bernard Lafferty surrendered his post as co-executor and membership in the Foundation. He was replaced by a Board of Trustees who took control over Doris Duke's assets. Bernard Lafferty died in 1996, where upon he willed his assets to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The collection spans the years 1952-1999, although the majority of the collection is 
concentrated in the years 1993-1996. The holdings in this collection are from Bernard Lafferty's personal files and 
include condolences after the death of Doris Duke, memoranda and correspondence regarding daily business activities 
of Doris Duke's estates and of the Foundation, invitations, meeting notes, lists of visitors to Duke Farms, and 
requests for donations.</abstract>
