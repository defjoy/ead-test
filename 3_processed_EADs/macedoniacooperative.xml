         <abstract>Founded in 1937 in Clarkesville (Habersham Co.), Ga. by Morris Randolph Mitchell; took name from nearby Baptist Church; comprised of families and individuals who worked collectively on the dairy, agricultural, forestry, and woodworking projects which provided the economic underpinnings of the community; originally an economic cooperative, Macedonia later passed through two distinct phases before its demise in 1958; at end of WWII an infusion of former civilian public service men, including conscientious objectors who had served prison sentences, joined the cooperative bringing an emphasis on pacifism; last stages of cooperative lasted from 1953-1957 when members of group explored the possibility of merging with the religious community known as the Society of Brothers (Bruderhof); in 1958 Macedonia ceased to be a separate community and property was sold at public auction on June 27, 1958. Collection comprises 4 flyers regarding the various wooden block sets made by the community for children. </abstract>
