         <p>The Explorers' Club was founded in September 1930 by a group of faculty members that included Alice Baldwin, Anne Gardiner, Justin Miller, and Ernest Seeman.  According to Burke Smith, one of the early members, the club had no formal membership, no dues, and no officers.  Several of the members decided where to go hiking and whom to invite. The names were selected from a list of more than 200 interested students. Trips were made very two weeks on a Sunday afternoon (sometimes on Saturdays). A leisurely walk through a wooded section was followed by a picnic meal around a campfire.  Twice a year, weekend trips were made to the mountains and to the sea.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
