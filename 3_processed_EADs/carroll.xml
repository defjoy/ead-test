         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Thomas Carroll span the years 1844 to 1914 with
the majority of the papers dating from 1844 to 1887. They consist
primarily of correspondence and accounts relating to his plantation,
general store, and guardianship of orphans.</p>
         
         <p>Carroll was a planter during the antebellum, Civil War, and
postwar periods. After the mid-1870's he lived in Virginia and elsewhere
in North Carolina, renting his farm to tenants. The correspondence
documents his plantation business, especially trade with commission
merchants between Norfolk, Virginia, and New York City and in
Liverpool, England. There are also references to slaves, freedmen, tenant
farmers, the cotton trade, and the agricultural economy and
Reconstruction in North Carolina and other Southern states where family
members lived. The Account Book, 1844-1867, contains lists of slaves
and transactions involving slave hiring, overseers, workers, wages,
midwives, a Petersburg merchant, educational expenses, and goods and
services for numerous persons including architect Jacob W. Holt. The
financial papers also document slaves, slave hiring, overseers, and
educational expenses.</p>
         
         <p>Carroll was the guardian of several orphans who included children
of Congressman Joel Holleman. Financial papers and the Account Book,
1844-1867, contain guardianship accounts.</p>
         
         <p>Two volumes from Carroll's general store document his mercantile
business before the Civil War. The ledger accounts include free blacks, a
shoe shop, Jacob W. Holt, and many slaves. The other volume contains
inventories of goods and debts.</p>
