         <p>Julian Shakespeare Carr was born October 12, 1845 to John W. Carr and Eliza P. Carr in
        North Carolina. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and served in
        the Confederate Army. After the war, Carr became a partner of W. T. Blackwell and Co., a
        tobacco manufacturing firm in Durham. His donation of land to Trinity College (Randolph
        County, N.C.), along with the financial support of Washington Duke, allowed the struggling
        school the opportunity to move to Durham. Carr served on the Board of Trustees of the
        College, prior to and after its move to Durham. In 1924, the school would be renamed Duke
        University. Carr died on April 29, 1924 and is buried in Durham's Maplewood Cemetery.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection includes about 72 items which cover the period when Carr served as Treasurer
        of the Board of Trustees of Trinity College (Randolph County, N.C.) and on the Committee of
        Management with John Wesley Alspaugh and James Alexander Gray. The bulk of this
        correspondence deals with attempts by Carr, largely unsuccessful, to call in notes pledged
        to the endowment of the College. There are significant letters from Alspaugh, Gray, and John
        Franklin Crowell, as well as a Treasurer's Report (circa 1885), other financial matters, and
        lists of Methodist Church assessments made to support Trinity College. Other subjects
        treated include the settlement of an estate, bills for the widow of Braxton Craven, and a
        student petition for the replacement of Professor W. T. Gannaway. There are also letters
        from John W. Sanborn, a candidate for the College's presidency. The other items in the
        collection include clippings and a photograph pertaining to the Carr family and homes; a
        farm journal (1910-1911) with instructions from Carr to his manager, B. S. Skinner, and
        samples of chewing and twist tobacco and handmade cigarettes produced in the 1880s at W. T.
        Blackwell's Durham tobacco company.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
