         <p>Virginia Passmore Beaujean, Class of 1942, entered the Woman's College of Duke University in the fall of 1938.  She was a native of Nottingham in Chester County, Pennsylvania and active in student life on the campus of the Woman's College (now East Campus).  Virginia Passmore Beaujean was a member of the Kappa Sigma sorority, the freshman and Sophomore "Y" Council, the Woman's Glee Club, the Choir, and the Dean's List.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The scrapbook contains material pertaining to Beaujean's experience as a student of the Woman's College at Duke University with inclusive dates of 1938-1942.  Material present includes material retained by Beaujean from Oxford High School in Nottingham, Pennsylvania including grade reports, her letter of admission to Duke, athletic and theatre ticket stubs and books, invitations and calling cards, Sigma Kappa sorority material, newspaper and magazine clippings, programs, and several artifacts.</p>
         
         <p>Additional material includes a Women's Athletic Association Handbook, and Order of Service for Duke University Church, a program for the Southern High School Invitational Basketball Tournament played at Duke Gymnasium in 1940, and numerous receipts showing tuition, room and board, and laboratory fees.  Also worthy of note is an October 18, 1938 letter from the President of Jarvis residence hall noting Beaujean's continuing disregard for the 11:30 PM lights-off rule and potential appearance before the House Committee if neglect continues.  Due to brittle pages, the scrapbook had been disassembled and individual pages foldered separately.</p>
