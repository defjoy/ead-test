         <p>Frances Klein (b. October 19, 1915) is a native of Cleveland, Ohio where she played trumpet in the Glenville High School Band. Around 1935, she was invited to play in Kermit Dart's All-Girl Band, which was led by Irene Vermillion. Klein traveled the country for two years with Vermillion's dance act/revue, "Rhapsody in Red." Upon returning to Cleveland, she was invited to tour with Ina Ray Hutton's All-Girl Traveling Band; after which, she returned again to Cleveland where she performed in a variety of local venues as a part of the Cleveland Women's Orchestra. Around that time, she was also the sole female member of Freddie Shafer's band. Klein led a number of bands, including: Frances Klein's All-Girl Orchestra, Frances Klein and Her Formal Swingsters, Frances Klein and her Moderniers, Frances Klein and Her Rhythm Boys, United States Marine Band (High School), and Frances Klein's All-Girl TV Band. On February 22, 1945, she married David Siskin and legally changed her name to Frances Siskin. In the late seventies, the Siskins moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where Klein continued playing trumpet in groups including the Jacksonville Bulls Pep Band, the Jacksonville Gator Pep Band, and a senior citizens band known as High Society.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
