         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>
The Walton Family Papers, 1730 to 1975 (bulk 1880-1975), include journals and diaries;
correspondence; writings; pictorial material such as postcards, photographs, albums and negatives;
clippings; mimeographed material; printed material; and genealogical material. While the majority
of the collection pertains to Loring Baker Walton, there also is a family focus, primarily in the
correspondence throughout the papers. In particular it relates to Loring Walton, his mother
Eleanore C. Walton, her father James Baker, and Eleanore Walton's husband George E. Walton.
The collection relates only peripherally to their careers.</p>
         
         <p>The lives of George and Eleanore Walton are documented in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="gews">
George and Eleanore Walton
Series</ref>. Most of the earliest items pertain to Mrs. Walton's family, the Bakers, who had settled in
Hingham, Massachusetts at least by the eighteenth-century. Letters to Mrs. Walton comprise a
major segment of this series, including those to her from her father, James Baker, 1880-1882.
Included are courtship letters from George Walton, a physician who attended Eleanore Walton
while she was convalescing near Deland, Florida. Most were written, 1891-1892, after she returned
to her home in Chicago. Letters from George Walton after the marriage suggest financial hardship
and indicate that the couple was frequently separated from the beginning of their marriage and
during the early childhood of their son Loring. After 1895, there is a gap in the correspondence.
Included is George Walton's 1896 diary of a trip via wagon from Indiana to Florida. Later material
and correspondence in the series pertains to Eleanore Walton's work as a clubwoman and motion
picture censor in Kansas City, Missouri from the 1920s to 1948, when she retired and moved to
Durham, N.C. to live with her son Loring Walton.</p>
         
         <p>The first series is a preview to the second, much larger <ref xlink:type="simple" target="lbws">Loring B. Walton Series</ref>. Four volumes of
journal entries describe Walton's daily life and thought as a student, first in Kansas City, Mo., and
later at Princeton University, which he entered in 1912. The journals record campus reaction to
Woodrow Wilson's election to the presidency. Walton was a graduate student at Harvard when he
was discharged from ROTC, called to active duty in the U.S. Army, and assigned to the American
Expeditionary Force in France and Germany in 1918-1919. During the war and its aftermath,
Walton assembled postcards and some photographs which complement his journal entries and
correspondence. Most of his letters in this series are addressed to his mother, Eleanore C. Walton,
with a few to his grandmother and aunt in Kansas City, Mo. Of interest are his characterizations of
civilians during the war and occupation as well as his view of political conditions. For over 30
years Walton corresponded with A. Goderic A. Hodges, a British Army officer who lost a leg while
in balloon service.</p>
         
         <p>To a limited extent there is information in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="lbws">Loring B. Walton Series</ref> about Walton's literary and
scholarly interests. A small quantity of correspondence is from authors such as Wilmon Brewer,
Count Sforza, and Maurice Holleaux. Included is a letter written by Anatole France, which was
given to Walton, and a handwritten, signed poem by Edmund Wilson. There are several draft
versions of Walton's addresses or articles, mostly undated. While there are no papers or
correspondence relating to Walton's study at the Sorbonne, one address refers to his living in the
home of a French family and his observations of French culture and educational methods. This
series also thinly documents his involvement with Duke University through the Interdenominational
Church and the Erasmus Club, and his sabbatical in Europe while a member of the Department of
Romance Languages.</p>
