         <abstract>Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP is a Minneapolis-based business law firm whose lawyers took on the pro bono cases of Bahraini detainees at the Guantánamo Bay detention center. The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records span the years 1997-2008, with the majority of the materials created between 2004 and 2008. The records consist largely of legal papers, news clippings, writings and correspondence regarding the cases of six Bahraini detainees: Jumah Al-Dossari, Abdullah Al-Nuaimi, Isa Al-Murbati, Salah Al-Balooshi, Adel Hajji and Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, kept under extra-judicial detention by the U.S. military at Camp Delta, Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G. Karagheuzoff took on the cases of Bahraini detainees pro bono in 2004. The records in this collection document the lawyers' legal motions, public campaigns and diplomatic negotiations for writ of habeas corpus and the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees. Many of these documents are also present in electronic form. The records are arranged in four series: Case Files, Correspondence, Publicity, and Digital Files. Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Dorsey and Whitney LLP is a business law firm which was founded in 1912 in Minneapolis, MN, where its headquarters are still located, to provide legal counseling to the First Bank of Minneapolis. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G. Karagheuzoff, from the New York Office of the firm took on the cases of Bahraini Guantánamo detainees <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph> in 2004. These lawyers represented the Bahraini detainees until the release and repatriation of all of them by 2008. Sullivan, Colangelo-Bryan and  Karagheuzoff did not only follow the legal cases of their Bahraini detainees but also got involved in public activities in order to raise awareness about the human rights situation and abuses at the military detention center in Guantánamo Naval Base. They also initiated negotiations with Bahraini diplomats and officials regarding the release and repatriation of their clients. The team of Dorsey &amp; Whitney lawyers also paid a visit to Bahrain to meet with the relatives of their clients.</p>
         
         <p>Jumah Al-Dossari is a joint citizen of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia detained in December 2001 in Pakistan, kept under arrest by the U.S. military in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and transferred to Camp Delta military detention center in January 2002 and eventually released without facing any charges in 2007. He suffered severe psychological and physical abuse both in Kandahar and Guantánamo. Al-Dossari  attempted suicide thirteen times and went on hunger strikes at least twice while under extra-judicial detention at Guantánamo. His case became an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo naval base and detrimental consequences of long term solitary confinement. Al-Dossari was represented by the Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP lawyer Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and he was repatriated to Saudi Arabia in 2007.</p>
         
         <p>Joshua Colangelo-Bryan is a Senior Attorney at the New York office of Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP. He gained his law degree in 1999 from the University of Washington School Of Law. Prior to working for Dorsey, Joshua served with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, where he participated in the prosecution of criminal cases involving war crimes and terrorism. He also has participated in post-conflict humanitarian aid work in the Balkans. He practices in the areas of complex civil litigation, employment law, and securities fraud. He also represents individuals and entities before federal and state agencies. He devotes a substantial portion of his practice to <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">pro bono</title> cases, including the representation of Guantánamo Bay detainees.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records span the years 1997-2008, with the majority of the materials created between 2004 and 2008. The records consist largely of legal papers, news clippings, writings and correspondence regarding the cases of six Bahraini detainees: Jumah Al-Dossari, Abdullah Al-Nuaimi, Isa Al-Murbati, Salah Al-Balooshi, Adel Hajji and Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, kept under extra-judicial detention by the U.S. military at Camp Delta, Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba.  A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G. Karagheuzoff took on the cases of Bahraini detainees <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph> in 2004. The records in this collection document the lawyers' legal motions, public campaigns and diplomatic negotiations for writ of habeas corpus and the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees, as well the surrounding issues of the Bush administration's responses to terrorism, the civil rights of prisoners of war, and the use of interrogation and torture at U.S. installations. Many of these documents are also present in the form of electronic files.</p>
         
         <p>
The records are divided into four series: Case Files, Correspondence, Publicity, and Digital Files.  The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Case Files Series</ref> (nine boxes of the thirteen in the collection) comprises petitions, filings, documents relating to the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CRST), and a wide variety of legal records regarding the six Bahrainis' and other concurrent  Guantánamo detainee cases. The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Correspondence Series</ref> includes exchanges between client detainees, Department of Justice officials, Bahraini diplomats and officials, U.S. senators and congressmen, law scholars, and colleagues of the Dorsey &amp; Whitney team representing the Guantánamo detainees. The letters and writings in this series cover issues and problems related to the legal status of Guantánamo detainees, human rights violations at Camp Delta, and diplomatic efforts for the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees. The high-profile case of Jumah Al-Dossari, detained in 2001 and eventually released without facing any charges in 2007, is covered in depth in this series, becoming an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo Naval Base and detrimental consequences of long term solitary confinement. Also covered in depth in the Correspondence Series is the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment approved by the Senate on November, 15 2005, which prohibits all habeas corpus claims by Guantánamo detainees and allows military tribunals to rely on evidence gathered by the use of torture. The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Publicity Series</ref> brings together news articles regarding Bahraini Guantánamo detainees, commentaries addressing the legal process and human rights issues, and interviews with Dorsey &amp; Whitney lawyers about the conditions at the military base and the legal and living situation of the detainees. The clippings in the collection were published by major news press and online media outlets worldwide, and include seven folders which hold many Arabic language news clippings. Many of the legal team's documents are also present in the form of electronic documents which are organized into folders described in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Digital Files Series.</ref> Also present is a twelve-minute unclassified audio recording on CD-R of the CRST hearing for Al-Murbati, and printed images of the families of the detainees. Original electronic files and recordings are closed to access but use copies may be requested; please contact a reference archivist.</p>
         
         <p>
The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records are composed of materials predominantly in the English language.  There is also a considerable amount of Arabic language materials in all three series. These chiefly consist of affidavits, letters by detainees and their relatives, and news clippings. Most of the Arabic language materials have English translations, with the exception of the news clippings. </p>

               <p>Comprises petitions, filings, documents relating to the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CRST), and a wide variety of legal records regarding the six Bahrainis' and Guantánamo detainees' cases such as Al-Odah and Boumediene. The series documents legal efforts of their lawyers for writ of habeas corpus, writ of certiorari, amelioration of living condition at Camp Delta, and finally for the release and repatriation of their clients. The series also contain documents regarding the government's efforts to preclude attempts to attain any rights for the detainees kept extra-judicially as enemy combatants by the U.S. military at Camp Delta. The series contains extensive material related to the workings and procedures of and trials by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT), which was established by the U.S. government on July 7, 2004. Also comprehensively covered in this series are the legal records and other documents concerning the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and Military Commission Act of 2006. The Bahraini detainees Al-Dossari and Al-Murbati cases are especially well-documented. The series is composed predominantly of materials in English language, but also contains many Arabic documents some of which are also translated into English. Other items include a twelve-minute unclassified audio recording on CD-R of CRST hearing for Al-Murbati (Box 4) and photographic images of the families of the detainees.</p>

               <p>The Correspondence Series includes writings between the attorneys and client detainees, Department of Justice officials, Bahraini diplomats and officials, U.S. senators and congressmen, law scholars, and colleagues of the Dorsey &amp; Whitney team representing the Guantanamo detainees. The writings cover issues and problems related to the legal status of Guantánamo detainees, human rights violations at Camp Delta and diplomatic efforts for the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees. The high-profile case of Jumah Al-Dossari is covered in depth in this series; his case became an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo naval base and detrimental consequences of long term solitary confinement. Also covered extensively is the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment approved by the Senate on November 15, 2005, which prohibits all habeas corpus claims by Guantánamo detainees and allows the military tribunals to rely on evidence gathered by the use of torture. The series mostly consists of letters, but there are also photocopies of photographic images from the visit of the lawyers to detainee relatives in Bahrain and court-related material attached to letters.
