         <abstract>The Duke University History of Medicine Collections acquire, preserve, interpret, and make available for research and instruction, materials documenting the history of medicine, biomedical science, health and disease in the global context of the Western medical tradition. The collection was assembled by Duke Medical Center Library staff, and contains newspapers and other oversize print materials related to the history of medicine.  The earliest date comes from a modern reproduction in black-and-white of an anatomical treatise from 1628.  Newspaper issues from the 18th and 19th centuries carry advertisements related to physicians' services, medical practices, and medicinal products.  Single sheets from the London Illustrated News concern the activities of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War, 1855-1856, and are illustrated with large black-and-white engravings; one issue reproduces a piece of music with verses praising Nightingale.  The items were acquired from various sources as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University. </abstract>
