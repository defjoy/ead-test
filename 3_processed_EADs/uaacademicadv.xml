         <p>The TCAS Academic Advising Center, formerly the TCAS Pre-Major Advising Center, located on East Campus provides academic advising resources to students before they declare a major. All freshmen are assigned an advisor upon matriculation and meet with this advisor until they declare their major, which must be done by the end of their fourth semester at Duke. The Academic Advising Center publishes a monthly newsletter and assists students with course selection, course dropping/adding, finding tutors, and major declaration among other things.</p>
