         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Born Nov. 7, 1908, in Philadelphia, Pa., Otto
		  Meier, Jr., was educated at the University of Pennsylvania
		  (B.S., 1929; E.E., 1937; Ph.D, 1957) and at the University
		  of Michigan (M.S., 1938). Meier was a technical observer
		  with the Geophysical Research Corporation in N.Y.
		  (1929-1930), and then worked as a private consultant with
		  C.D. Fawcett, E.E., in Philadelphia (1930-1934).</p>
         
         <p>Meier came to Duke University in 1934 as an
		  instructor (1934-1938) in electrical engineering and taught
		  as an assistant professor (1938-1945), associate professor
		  (1945-1957), and professor (1957-1975). Meier's specialties
		  were electrical machinery and control, illumination,
		  explosives, nucleonics, and experimental nuclear
		  physics.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to teaching, Meier filled many
		  administrative posts at Duke University. He was Chairman of
		  the Schedule and Registration Committee of the College of
		  Engineering (1947-1948), President of the Duke Faculty Club
		  (1948-1949), Acting Chairman of the Electrical Engineering
		  Dept. (1950), Director of Undergraduate Studies in

		  Office at various high schools in the region.</p>
         
         <p>As a consultant and researcher, Meier worked with
		  the Engineering Corps of the U.S. Army (1941), the
		  Explosives Division of the U.S. Naval Ordnance Lab (1949),
		  and the Oak Ridge National Lab (1950). Beginning in 1950,
		  Meier was an engineering consultant and researcher with the
		  Nuclear Structure Lab at Duke, and consultant engineer with
		  the Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab. Meier played an
		  active role in the planning of the facility during its
		  construction.</p>
         
         <p>Meier belonged to numerous professional
		  engineering and scientific organizations. He was active in
		  the N.C. section of the American Institute of Electrical
		  Engineers, the Durham Engineers Club, and the Duke chapters
		  of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Otto Meier, Jr., Records and Papers is divided
		  into eight major series:
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Personal and Biographical
			 Files</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">General Subject Files</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Duke University</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">School of Engineering</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Organizations</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Papers and Articles</ref>;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7">Photos and Slides</ref>; and the
		  records of the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s8">Tau Beta Pi</ref>.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Personal and Biographical
			 Files</ref> Series contains Meier's Ph.D. thesis; texts of
		  his lectures and addresses; materials documenting
		  conferences he attended; and materials used on his trips as
		  a Duke University Admissions Office representative to
		  regional high schools. Also, in this series are very
		  extensive files on the courses Meier taught at Duke. These
		  files include detailed notes, projects, tests, solutions to
		  test questions, and course evaluations.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">General Subject Files</ref> mainly
		  contain correspondence, memoranda, and reports that
		  document Meier's committee work at Duke. There is
		  considerable material on the Faculty Club and on ROTC, and
		  a minor amount on early computers at Duke. There are
		  documents (agendas, papers, and programs) that deal with
		  the activities of the Southeastern Electric Exchange, a
		  regional utilities group, whose meetings Meier frequently
		  attended.</p>
         
         <arrangement>
            
            <p>The General Subject Files are arranged
			 alphabetically.</p>
         
         </arrangement>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Duke University</ref> Series
		  consists mainly of minutes and memoranda of the University
		  Council/Academic Council (1953-1973); the Graduate Faculty
		  and its executive committee; the University Faculty
		  (1953-1973); and the University Faculty
		  Council/Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences
		  (1967-1972). One binder contains minutes, correspondence,
		  reports, and budgets of the Duke University Church and its
		  Board (1953-1956). There are several folders of University
		  memoranda on a variety of topics (1935-1942).</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">School of Engineering</ref> Series
		  contains the minutes and related papers of the School of
		  Engineering, known as the College of Engineering until
		  1966. It includes materials from the Engineering
		  Administrative Council (1968-1974), Engineering Faculty
		  (1953-1974), and the Engineering Faculty Council
		  (1947-1974). In some cases the accounts and comments are
		  more detailed than those in the published minutes. This
		  series also has general information on topics such as
		  administrators; articles and papers by Duke University
		  faculty and students; the Board of Visitors; the
		  engineering building, former faculty, and research and
		  development. </p>
         
         <p>The Dept. of Electrical Engineering is an
		  important subseries within the School of Engineering
		  Series. It contains files on curriculum (1953-1954),
		  minutes of the graduate faculty (1963-1964), and "status
		  reports" from the years 1957, 1962, and 1967. This includes
		  compilations of staff rosters, course descriptions, vitae,
		  and available facilities. There is a sizeable collection of
		  folders entitled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Staff,</title> (1953-1954),
		that contain minutes of the electrical engineering faculty
		meetings, memoranda, reports, and other papers on general
		policies.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Organizations</ref> Series
		  contains correspondence, newsletters, minutes of regional
		  conferences for twenty different organizations. The largest
		  collections concern the American Institute of Electrical
		  Engineers (ca. 1933-1963); Delta Epsilon Sigma (ca
		  1931-1946); the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
		  Engineers (ca. 1963-1971); and the campus chapter of Tau
		  Beta Pi (ca. 1948-1975). There are also extensive materials
		  from the Durham, N.C., Engineers Club (ca. 1944-1974), in
		  which Meier was an active member. Some organizations are
		  represented by only a few items retained by Meier. There
		  are two folders on Phi Beta Kappa at Duke (1962) and Sigma
		  Xi (ca. 1939-1974).</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Papers and Articles</ref> Series
		  includes addresses and papers given by others at various
		  engineering conferences in the 1950-1960s. Of note are the
		  papers from the Southeastern Electric Exchange on
		  technical, electrical, and electronics subjects. Included
		  are speeches by officials of utility companies on nuclear
		  power in its early days.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7">Photographs and Slides</ref>
		  Series illustrates the life of engineering students in the
		  1930s; the engineering building (Southgate) and laboratory
		  on East Campus; West Campus; and the construction of the
		  Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory. There are lantern
		  slides that contain diagrams of nuclear particle processes,
		  schematics for a Van de Graaff accelerator, and photographs
		  of the installation of the 4MeV Van de Graaff in the
		  nuclear facility of the Physics Dept. There are also 3 and
		  1/2 inch x 5 inch slides for a presentation on
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Electric Power Utilities -
		  Trends and Nuclear Outlook.</title>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The slides are fragile. Please consult University
		  Archives staff before use.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s8">Tau Beta Pi</ref> Series contains
		  material from the North Carolina Gamma Chapter of Tau Beta
		  Pi, national engineering honorary, established at Duke
		  University on Jan. 10, 1948. The material contains banquet
		  initiation programs (1949-1970), correspondence, bulletins,
		  and printed material on the history, purpose, constitution,
		  and other aspects of Tau Beta Pi. It includes two large
		  bound volumes,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Book of the Chairman of the
		  Advisory Board,</title> (1948-1950, 1950-1958). There is
		also a large amount of material on the National Convention
		of 1960. Access to Boxes 17-18 is RESTRICTED: Student

				faculty and students; the Board of Visitors; the
				engineering building, former faculty, and research and
				development. The subseries on the Dept. of Electrical
				Engineering is an important part of this series. It
				contains files on curriculum (1953-1954), minutes of the
				graduate faculty (1963-1964), and "status reports" from the
				years 1957, 1962, and 1967. The School of Engineering was
				known as the College of Engineering until 1966. </p>

				The largest collections concern the American Institute of
				Electrical Engineers (ca. 1933-1963); Delta Epsilon Sigma
				(ca. 1931-1946); the Institute of Electrical and
				Electronics Engineers (ca. 1963-1971); and the campus
				chapter of Tau Beta Pi (ca. 1948-1975). There are also
				extensive materials from the Durham, N.C., Engineers Club
				(ca. 1944-1974), in which Meier was an active member. Some
				organizations are represented by only a few items retained
				by Meier. There are two folders on Phi Beta Kappa at Duke
				(1962) and Sigma Xi (ca. 1939-1974). </p>
