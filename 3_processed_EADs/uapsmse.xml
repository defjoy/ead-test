         <p>The Program to Strengthen Medical Science Education began in the fall of 1976 as a means to foster the transition from a liberal, pre-professional education to a graduate-professional education for Duke undergraduates interested in a career in medicine.  The program required the formation of a close working relationship between Arts and Sciences and Medical faculty.  It was supported by the Commonwealth Fund for four years; a proposal for a fifth year of support was turned down, ending the Program.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
