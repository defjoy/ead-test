         <abstract>Alonzo William Slayback (1879-1969), of St. Louis, Missouri, was the youngest of six children and the only son of Col. Alonzo W. Slayback (1838-1882) and Alice A. Waddell (1839-). The collection includes two diaries kept by Alonzo William Slayback from 1898 to 1901. The first diary consists of 17 double-sided pages of remarks fastened with a metal brad to several small slips of paper that serve as an index. The 43 numbered remarks, which range in date from October 20, 1898, to August 19, 1899, and undated, describe Slayback's conversations, encounters, and dates with several different women. The second diary, a small account book from the Merchant's National Bank of St. Louis, contains 42 pages of letters addressed to V, Veda, or Olga; the woman Slayback loved whose fickleness elicited passionate and conflicted feelings in him. Eighteen letters are dated from December 4, 1899, to November 16, 1901. Together, the diaries provide insight into dating and courtship in St. Louis, Mo., at the end of the 19th century.</abstract>
