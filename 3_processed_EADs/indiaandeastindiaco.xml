         <abstract>The East India Company was an English joint-stock company formed in 1600 that ruled portions of South Asia until 1858.  This collection contains over 55 documents including miscellaneous legal papers, correspondence, receipts, and extracts largely relating to the East India Company's operations and employees; three documents relating to Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nabob of Arcot (1745-1795); manuscripts relating to Sir Robert Chambers (1737-1803), who traveled to India in 1774 as one of the first justices of the Supreme Court at Calcutta; and a petition written by the wife of Almas Ali Khan, an important administrator in Awadh and one of the key figures in the trial of Warren Hastings. These manuscripts seem to have formerly been part of Sir Thomas Phillipps noted collection.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>This collection contains over 55 documents in four discrete folders. The first folder contains miscellaneous legal documents, correspondence, receipts, and extracts largely relating to East India Company operations and employees, including the earliest document in the collection, a 1691 transfer of EIC stock signed by Sir Josia[h] Child.  Some of the manuscripts in the collection appear to have been once in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps. The second folder contains three documents relating to Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nabob of Arcot (1745-1795). The third folder contains manuscripts relating to Sir Robert Chambers, who traveled to India in 1774 as one of the first justices of the Supreme Court at Calcutta. The collection of Chambers' manuscripts includes letters to the Justices at Calcutta as a whole, a fragmentary legal opinion, and a petition written by the wife of Almas Ali Khan, an important administrator in Awadh and one of the focal points in the trial of Warren Hastings. The fourth folder contains one bound volume of miscellaneous correspondence, some related to the case of merchant James Paull (1770-1808), formerly in the noted collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps.</p>

                  <p>This volume was part of a series of miscellaneous autograph letterbooks in Sir Thomas Phillipps' library originally collected by Robert Cole. This particular book contains MS fragments, letters, and autographs of famous Anglo-Indian political figures. There are around nineteen separate pieces in the collection totaling about 110 pages and ranging in date from the 1780s to 1810s. Many of the pieces relate to James Paull (1770-1808), a merchant in the Indian trade and later MP, his conduct in India, and his accusations against Lord Wellesley, circa 1804-1806 (copies of some of this material may also be found in BL Add. MS 13,532). The volume also contains a small series of letters relating to military campaigns around Madras, 1781-1783, signed by various officers including John Garstin and A.W. Hervey. In addition, the collection includes one letter to Lord Frederick North from [Alexander] Hannay dated 1783. There is also one unsigned letter to Lord George Macartney, most likely from Mohamed Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nabob of Arcot, dated March 8, 1783.</p>
