         <abstract>E. Ireland was a mature, unmarried Scottish woman at the time she authored a series of travel diaries from 1916 to 1920.

The diaries document Ireland's travels throughout the United States, Canada, Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea, New Britain, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Japan, South Africa, and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe).
