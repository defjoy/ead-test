         <abstract>Merchant in Augusta, Georgia. Chiefly correspondence of William T. Richards and his
                family and friends. Richards was a New England native, and three early letters from
                the 1840s are from a sister in Danbury, Connecticut. One letter from Chattooga
                County, Georgia (1865 Aug. 31) speaks of the devastation in that area from the Civil
                War. An early item is a power of attorney of 1833 from the merchant Joseph Ganahl to
                Francis Ganahl. Also includes a bill for goods bought in New York, N.Y. in October,
                1865; invitations; announcements; and clippings which relate to William Hill, once
                Secretary of State for North Carolina. One item is an announcement of William T.
                Richard's retirement in 1903 as treasurer and paymaster of the Georgia Railroad.
                Some materials relate to the Hill and Thomas families in N.C., but their relation to
                the Richards family is unknown.</abstract>
