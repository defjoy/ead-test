         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The diaries of William James Carlton span the years 1862 to 1877; the biography dates
				to about 1964. There are transcripts of the diaries and a draft manuscript of a
				biography, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Portrait of William James
					Carlton, 1838-1902,</title> by Frankie McKee Robins. The transcripts are
				slightly annotated. For the years from 1862 to November 1864 the diaries chronicle
				William James Carlton's participation in the United States Civil War. From 1864 to
				1877, the diaries primarily describe family events and church-related activities. A
				December 1873 entry indicates that no diaries were kept for the years 1865 to 1872.
				The bulk of the biography describes the years from 1861 to 1862.</p>
         
         <p>The diaries begin during approximately the fifth month of William Carlton's
				enlistment in the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. His entries describe
				drills, recreation and holiday celebrations, sermons addressed to the troops,
				illness, and funerals. He briefly describes incidents and comradely associations
				among various regiments, including the 3rd Rhode Island [Heavy?] Artillery. Most of
				the descriptions of battles are from an observer's point of view but there are some
				sketchy descriptions of those in which he participated. Ships carrying troops,
				supplies, and mail are frequently named. During the period in which the 48th
				Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry was in the areas of Hilton Head and Daufuskie
				Island, South Carolina, and Fort Pulaski, Georgia, William Carlton visited the local
				area. He describes trips to Jones, Bird, and Tybee islands in Georgia. While on
				Daufuskie Island, the Stoddard plantation on Calibogue Sound was occupied by his
				regiment.</p>
         
         <p>Entries from 1862 to 1864 reveal William Carlton's personal interests and activities.
				They include frequent discourse about specific books, magazines, and newspapers he
				read, with comments on authors and texts and comparisons of different titles.
				Correspondence between family and friends is regularly noted, including <emph render="doublequote">sub rosas</emph> to a brother. There are observations about
				African Americans, some of whom were escaped slaves, others were servants or in
				another sort of service to the Union, and a Black regiment, which Mr. Carlton refers
				to as the South Carolina Volunteers.</p>
         
         <p>The diaries for 1873 to 1877 primarily discuss family activities and illness, the
				children's social development, and birthdays and holiday celebrations in Elizabeth,
				N.J., and nearby areas of New York. The Carltons were members of St. Paul's,
				probably a Methodist Episcopal church, in Elizabeth. Church-related activities were
				central in family life and included attendance at Sunday School and services. The
				diaries have notes about various preachers and the titles of sermons they gave.
				William Carlton was a trustee of the church. He was also on the board of the YMCA
				(probably the Young Men's Christian Association) and served as its Treasurer in
				1873. His advertising business is mentioned only cursorily in the Diaries. In the
				entry for December 5, 1864, he wrote, <emph render="doublequote">Commenced to canvas
					for advertisements this morning for several papers.</emph> Most other
				business-related entries merely note that he went to the office. In 1873 Mr. Carlton
				was the chair of the Committee on Credentials for the Advertising Agents Convention
				held at the Astor House. In 1877 he discussed the purchase of the Lady's Book with
				Mr. [Louis Antoine] Godey. There are a few mentions of Mr. Carlton's employee, <emph render="doublequote">Thompson</emph> [James Walter Thompson], including social
				occasions he shared with Mr. Carlton. James Walter Thompson bought the William J.
				Carlton agency from Mr. Carlton in 1878 and renamed it the J. Walter Thompson
				Company.</p>
         
         <p>The biography briefly describes William James Carlton's early years, including his
				family and education. The bulk of the Biography describes William Carlton's military
				service and the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. The biography Appendix
				includes information from secondary sources, such as biographical sketches of
				members of the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry and other military
				officers; excerpts from reports and published sources about the 48th Regiment, New
				York Volunteer Infantry; and other aspects of the Civil War. The biography Outline
				includes scattered, brief references to the William J. Carlton's advertising
				business but is predominantly descriptive of family life.</p>
