         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>John B. McFerrin was a professor of finance at the University of Florida, as well as a past president of the Southern Economic Association. His Ph.D. was from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with his dissertation on Caldwell and Company. McFerrin's book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Caldwell and Company: A Southern Financial Empire</title>, was first published in 1939 and updated in 1969.</p>
         
         <p>Caldwell and Company was founded in Nashville in 1917 by Rogers C. Caldwell. Originally a municipal bonds distributor, the company grew rapidly--first selling real estate bonds and industrial securities, and later acquiring ownership and interests in banks (including the Bank of Tennessee), newspapers, and other ventures, including Nashville's professional baseball team. By 1929, it was the largest investment banking house in the south.</p>
         
         <p>All was not well with the company's finances, however. Rogers Caldwell charged his personal expenses to the company, securities were substituted unethically, and the business had inadequate cash reserves to legally cover its investments. Caldwell and Company also became involved in state politics, financially backing Colonel Luke Lea and his interests. (Lea was also from Nashville, a former United States Senator, and a newspaper publisher.) Lea's influence with the state government, including Governor Henry Horton, led to significant deposits of Tennessee money into Caldwell banks, bypassing competitive bidding for state-funded projects. In September 1930, bank examiners discovered the low cash reserves, and on November 7 the Bank of Tennessee was declared insolvent. The collapse of Caldwell and Company immediately followed, including runs on other company-owned banks across the South. On November 14, 1930, the company went into receivership.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Includes two copies of John B. McFerrin's book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Caldwell and Company: A Southern Financial Empire</title>, as well as supporting documents (the majority dating from the 1920s-1930s) gathered by McFerrin during the research and writing of his book. The materials represent a sampling of material from Caldwell and Company. Pre-financial collapse material consists largely of sales support, including information and literature meant for distribution by the Caldwell and Company salesmen. Topics range from municipal bonds, mortgage real estate bonds, securities and investment pamphlets, life insurance, and informational newsletters about Caldwell products. Post-1930 materials relate largely to the fallout from the financial collapse of Caldwell, including various court case briefs, indentures, a report from Lee Douglas and Rutledge Smith, Caldwell and Company Receivers, and a consolidated schedule with the financial records of the company and the Bank of Tennessee. Also included are newspaper clippings, dated 1896-1980; an article by McFerrin about the Kentucky Rock Asphalt Company; and other miscellaneous materials.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
