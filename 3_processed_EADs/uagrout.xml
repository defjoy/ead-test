         <p>Julia Rebecca Grout, known to most as <emph render="doublequote">Jerry,</emph> was born on
		  April 1, 1898 in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. She attended Mount Holyoke College, where she was
		  an outstanding athlete, and received her bachelor's degree in 1920. She received a Master of
		  Science from Wellesley College in 1928. </p>
         
         <p>Almost all of Grout's career was spent at Duke University. She arrived in 1924 and soon
		  became Director (later called Chairman) of Physical Education for Women, a position she held until
		  her retirement in 1964. During her tenure, the department offered a wide variety of required and
		  elective physical education courses, oversaw recreational and athletic activities, and encouraged
		  women students to be physically active. Grout was an advocate for improved facilities for women
		  students, which is documented in her departmental memoir,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">As You Were, or Forty Years of <emph render="doublequote">Happenings</emph>
		  in the Department of Health and Physical Education, The Woman's College, Duke University,
		  1924-1964.</title> This memoir can be found in the Addresses and Writing series of these
		papers.</p>
         
         <p>After her retirement in 1964, Grout remained an active, travelling frequently and staying
		  in close contact with her colleagues at Duke University. She died on April 22, 1984. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Julia R. Grout Papers include correspondence, clippings, writings, printed matter,
		  photographs, and other materials related to Grout's professional and personal interests. The papers
		  are divided into four series. The Personal series includes Grout's resume, retirement materials,
		  tributes to her, and documents related to her funeral. One of the retirement materials is a large
		  bound volume of letters written to Grout by students and colleagues expressing their appreciation
		  for her forty years of service at Duke. The second series, Correspondence, has a brief selection of
		  letters related to Grout's professional career, her 1958 travels to Southern Africa, and work on
		  the Dedication Committee of Baldwin Auditorium. The third series, Addresses and Writings, includes
		  a variety of speeches, papers, and reports written by Grout over her career. Topics include the
		  need for physical education for women, American physical education compared to that of Europe, and
		  the history of physical education for women at Duke. Also included in this series are several
		  speeches made by Grout at the retirement parties of other faculty and staff of the Woman's College.
		  The final series, Professional Travels, documents Grout's international travels to Europe in 1938
		  and 1958, where she studied the physical education programs of Sweden, Holland, and Norway.</p>
