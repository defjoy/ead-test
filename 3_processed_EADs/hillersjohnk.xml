         <abstract> John K. Hillers was an important early
        American photographer and one of the first to photograph the Grand Canyon and the high
        plateaus of central and southern Utah. Collection contains albumen photographs spanning the years
        1871-1889. Most of them are landscapes made in Utah, but there are also landscapes from
        California and several photographs of Native Americans made in New Mexico. The photographs
        are organized into six series. </abstract>

            <p>This collection was previously processed by Rubenstein Archivist Bill Erwin in 1982.
          Erwin conducted a great deal of research used to identify photographs made by western
          expeditionary photographers. Every effort was made to retain both the organization and
          informational aspects of his work except when they conflicted with more modern
          practices.</p>
            
            <p>Information folders available in the repository contain copies of earlier catalog records
          and bibliographic information for related sources including sources in which these
          photographs have been published.</p>
            
            <p>Additional folders contain photocopies of photographs annotated by the National Archives,
          and reference prints made from copy negatives held in this collection.</p>
            
            <p>Quotation marks indicate a title taken directly from the photograph, or from a printed
          caption on the mounting board. A title taken from a handwritten caption on the mounting
          boards is not enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>
            John K. Hillers, one of America's most important early photographers,
        was one of the first to photograph the Grand Canyon and most of the high plateaus of central
        and southern Utah. In the fall of 1872, at the request of the Western lands survey, Hillers
        turned his lens from features of the landscape to its Native American inhabitants and
        photographed the Zuni and San Juan Pueblos. The 40 single albumen photographs and the 539
        prints in the photograph album in this collection span the years 1871-1889.</p>
         
         <p>Of the 40 single photographs in the collection, 33 are landscapes, many of which Hillers
        made in Utah. Five of the landscapes are from California. Seven photographs portray Native
        Americans, primarily Pueblo and Zuni in New Mexico. These photographs are organized into six
        series: <emph render="bold">Official Identification of the Survey Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Gold Border Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Indian Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">1873 Powell Survey Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Black Border
          Series</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">California Series.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The photograph album added to this collection contains 539 original albumen prints, most of
        which were taken by Hillers on the Second Expedition; others were taken by E. O. Beaman and
        James Fennemore on the same Expedition. The majority are from the Colorado River region in
        Colorado and Utah, and feature landscapes and vistas, expedition camps, Paiute Indians, and
        natural features. The prints may have been assembled by Hillers himself, or by John Powell
        as a gift for a patron or Congressman.</p>

               <p>The photographs are not dated, but eight of the landscapes have printed headings for
            the "Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, Second Division,
              J.W. Powell, Geologist in Charge." John Wesley Powell became the director
            of the Second Division in 1875, and the organization was renamed the
              Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region
            in 1877. Thus, these eight pictures were printed and mounted during 1875-1877.
            Additionally, an artistic gold border surrounds each image. The photographs were not
            numbered or captioned, but someone has pencilled captions on the back of the boards. The
            following list uses these captions.</p>

               <p>The gold borders around the images are identical to the gold borders around the
            photographs on which the name of the Survey was printed. In this series there is no
            printing. These photographs were also not numbered or captioned, but someone has written
            captions on the front of the boards using purple ink. Someone else has further
            identified some of the photographs with pencilled notations on the back of the boards.
            The list below uses these handwritten captions.</p>

               <p> The images in this series are mounted on boards that have black decorative borders
            around the photographs that are very similar in conception but different in detail from
            the gold borders around the images of the above two series. The tone of the images in
            this series is distinctly darker than in other series. In one case, a direct comparison
            is possible. There are identical views of Winslow's Cascade in both this series and in
            one of the others. Someone has pencilled captions on the backs of the boards, and the
            list below uses these captions.</p>

               <p>Hillers made these ten photographs on the Powell Survey during 1873. He took most, if
            not all, of them in Utah and in the Grand Canyon. The photographs do not have captions
            or other marks of identification. Comparison with prints and negatives at the National
            Archives has provided the identification of these photographs. The relevant National
            Archives number has been provided in the list below.</p>

               <p>These five photographs have either printed titles or else titles handwritten on the
            back of the boards. The photographs themselves do not indicate the photographer's name.
            The Still Pictures Branch of the National Archives examined copies of these photographs,
            and identified them by comparison with photographs attributed to Hillers. Mr. Joe D.
            Thomas, Chief Still Pictures Branch, of the National Archives has written, however, that
            Hillers "may not have been the actual photographer." The photographs may date from the
            early 1880s. The images are mounted on gilt-edged and are identical in size and mounting
            to two photographs by William Henry Jackson. See his Yellowstone
            National Park Series. The numbers for the negatives to which they relate in the National
            Archives are provided below.</p>

               <p>Album of 539 original albumen photographs taken by John Hillers, E. O. Beaman, and
            James Fennemore during the second Powell Expedition along the Colorado River in Utah and
            Arizona, with some locations in Nevada and Wyoming as well. The largest majority measure
            4.25 x 3 inches; another seven are 7.25 x 9.5"; and 53 are 4.25 x 7.25". Most of the
            photographs in this album have been identified as taken by John K. Hillers and may have
            been selected by Hillers himself, or by John Powell. Other photographs in the album were
            taken by E.O. Beaman and James Fennemore, the first two photographers on the Powell
            Expedition.</p>
               
               <p>The images chiefly portray the landscape explored and documented by the Second Powell
            Expedition, including rivers, mountains, cliffs, and other features, but there are also
            over 100 photographs of Indians, mostly the Paiute of Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Several
            of the earliest photographs in the album have a slightly out of focus quality,
            characteristic of E.O. Beaman's work. Foremost among the photographs that are
            identifiably by Beaman is a pair showing the Powell expeditionary party in their three
            boats on the Green River in Wyoming in May, 1871, as they began their journey. In both
            of these prints, Beaman's photographic apparatus can be seen. Several of the photographs
            show the Powell party at work or in camp, repairing their boat or relaxing.</p>
               
               <p>More than one hundred of the photographs in this album are stereoviews of Southern
            Paiute Indians in Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. In several photographs John Wesley Powell
            or his associates can be seen interacting with Paiutes, either in informal meetings,
            observing Indian dances or groups, or in staged photographs (including one of Paiutes
            with a group of Mormons). The album is notable for the presence of two kinds of images
            of Native Americans: those that are taken by Hillers for the purpose of ethnographically
            accurate studies, during the 1872 expedition, and those that are instead more staged for
            public consumption, taken when Hillers returned to the area a year later. [Description
