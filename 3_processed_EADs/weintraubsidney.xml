         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Sidney Weintraub (1914-1983) was an American economist and a professor who specialized in the post-Keynesian school of economics. He was best known for his proposal to use the federal income tax to discourage wage and price inflation in a tax-based incomes policy (TIP). Raised in New York, Weintraub studied at the London School of Economics before being forced to return to the United States at the outbreak of World War II. He earned his Ph.D. from New York University in 1941, and began teaching economics at St. John's University following the war. He joined the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950, where he remained for the rest of his career. Weintraub also founded and co-edited the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Post Keynesian Economics</title>. </p>
         
         <p>Weintraub married Sheila Ellen Weintraub and had two sons, E. Roy and A. Neil Weintraub. E. Roy Weintraub is an economics professor at Duke University.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>These files document much of Sidney Weintraub's career as an economist; material dates from the early part of his professional career, 1938, until his death in 1983; it also includes some post-humous material from 1984. The collection is arranged into seven series: Correspondence, Subject Files, Writings, Miscellany, Clippings, Photographs, and Printed Material. There are also descriptions of additions and oversize materials following the main collection description. Weintraub is best known for his work on inflation, wages and prices, unemployment, economic growth, and post-Keynesian monetary theory. Other significant topics in the papers include Weintraub's work with the U.S. government on economic policies, and his travels in England during and after World War II.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Correspondence Series</ref> contains letters between 1939 and 1983. Weintraub, who did much of his own typing, scrupulously preserved carbon-copies of the letters that he sent to others which are included in the files, along with original letters sent to him by others. The bulk of the correspondence is dated between 1970 and 1983, a time when Weintraub was at the University of Pennsylvania and Waterloo in Canada (see Accession 2009-0178 for earlier correspondence). Weintraub regularly corresponded with a number of economists, including: Joan Robinson, Martin Brofenbrenner, Nicholas Kaldor, Abba Lerner, Henry Wallich, John K. Galbraith, Roy Harrod, Francis Seton, E. Roy Weintraub, Alice Vandermeulen, G.C. Harcourt, and many others. He also corresponded with many non-economists, including: Senators Barry Goldwater, William Proxmire, Gary Hart, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. An addition from 2009 consists largely of Weintraub's personal correspondence to his wife, Sheila Ellen Weintraub, during World War II and his post-war travels. It has been added to the end of the collection.</p>
         
         <p>One problem arises when using the material in the Correspondence Series of Weintraub's papers, since this section is indexed and stored by year or portion of a year and not by author or receiver of the correspondence. Therefore, for the years 1970 through 1983, it is difficult to find particular letters for particular individuals if the date for the correspondence is unknown. For earlier years this is not such a problem given the smaller number of letters in the files prior to 1970.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Subject Files Series</ref> is the largest, comprising nearly one-fourth of the initial collection. The material grows out of research undertaken by Weintraub primarily during the period 1970 to 1983 when he was attempting to influence government policy by promoting the merits of a Taxed-Based Incomes Policy (TIP). Of particular interest here is the early work on the publication of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Capitalism's Inflation and Unemployment Crisis</title>. Also of interest is the work that Weintraub did for the Canadian Institute for Economic Policy. In this series the material concerning the founding of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Post Keynesian Economics</title> is included. This includes correspondence with co-editor Paul Davidson and publisher M.E. Sharpe, Inc. There is also some preliminary correspondence having to do with the publication and writing of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Keynes and the Monetarists</title>. These files contain material dealing with Weintraub's extensive national and international lecturing tours, with materials from trips to Europe, Asia, Puerto Rico, and much of the United States. Finally, material on the writing of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Modern Economic Thought</title>, editorials for the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">New York Times</title>, and the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Puerto Rico Economic Quarterly</title> is included in this category.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Writings Series</ref> includes work both by Weintraub himself and by others, both published and unpublished. Of Weintraub's own work, there are early versions and drafts of works later published. For example, one finds early work on the published piece <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Keynes and the Monetarists and Other Essays</title>, by Sidney Weintraub along with Hamid Habibagahi, Henry Wallich, and E. Roy Weintraub (1973). Also included is some early work on the 1981 book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Our Stagflation Malaise</title>. Several unpublished drafts can also be found here including portions of the uncompleted work <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Economic Thought: 1945-1965</title>, which also had the title <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Recent Developments in Economic Theory</title>. Other uncompleted works are <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Economics of Capitalism and Keynesian Evolution: A Theory of Employment, Growth, Income Distribution, Inflation and Money, with Policy Implications.</title> This rather lengthy title was the second revised title of a proposed book that assessed both the microeconomic and macroeconomic components of Post Keynesian monetary theory. Finally in this section are the completed, yet unpublished, works <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Pricing Interstate Telephone Services: Some Aspects of FCC Regulations of the Bell System Pricing Policies</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Theory of the Structure of Interest Rates.</title>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Miscellany Series</ref> contains other writings by Weintraub at different times in his professional career. Of particular interest is Weintraub's testimony to various congressional committees and federal regulatory bodies. Also included are Weintraub's handwritten notes on several of the graduate and undergraduate classes that he taught, including The History of Economic Thought, Recent Developments of Economic Theory, Theories of Business Cycles, Theory of Value and Distribution, an Introduction to Mathematical Economics, Price and Distribution Theory, Seminar in Selected Problems of Economic Theory, Public Finance and Modern Economic Theory, Keynesian Economics, Topics in Macroeconomics, and partial notes on other courses and subjects as well.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Clippings Series</ref> contains newspaper and magazine articles by Weintraub or about his economic theories. They are written pieces from the popular press. Included in the clippings are letters to the editor from publications throughout the United States and Canada. For the most part, these articles by Weintraub or mentioning Weintraub deal with aspects of Taxed-Based Incomes Policy (TIP). Though not all of these clippings related to economics, the majority of them do.</p>
         
         <p>Both the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Photographs</ref> and the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Printed Material</ref> series of the files are limited. The former contains only a few black and white publicity pictures from one or more of Weintraub's speaking tours. The latter houses only a few journal reprints. Of special interest in the volumes series is an unpublished manuscript sent to Henry Wallich at the time of their first collaboration on Taxed-Based Incomes Policy. It outlines, in detail, Weintraub's ideas on the subject from Professor Wallich.</p>
         
         <p>The group of materials added to the main collection at a later date deals with research that Weintraub was considering at the time of his death. This includes an early draft of a book, titled <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Post Keynesian Evolution</title>. In these files are also condolence letters received by Mrs. Weintraub at the time of her husband's death, along with various obituaries and eulogies.</p>
         
         <p>Accession (2009-0178) (1.2 lin. ft.; 900 items; dated 1937-1971) consists largely of Weintraub's personal correspondence to his wife, Sheila Ellen Weintraub, during World War II and his post-war travels. Other correspondents include his brother and his son. These letters offer excellent insight into Weintraub's activities during the war, as well as descriptions of London and India in the pre-war and post-war period. This accession has been added to the end of the collection; see below for box numbers.</p>

               <p>Accession (2009-0178) (1.2 lin. ft.; 900 items; dated 1938-1983) consists largely of Weintraub's personal correspondence to his wife, Sheila Ellen Weintraub, during World War II and his post-war travels. Other correspondents include his brother and his son. These letters offer excellent insight into Weintraub's activities during the war, as well as detailed descriptions of London and India in the pre-war and post-war period. There are also photographs and memorabilia.</p>
