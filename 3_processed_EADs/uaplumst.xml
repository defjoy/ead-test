         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Plummer Stewart was born on July 13, 1870 in Union County, North Carolina. His parents were Robert and Sallie Stewart, and his father was a confederate veteran.  Stewart graduated from Trinity College in 1894.  He became a member of the Charlotte bar in 1901 and was at one time a law partner of Judge John A. Parker, Judge William H. Bobbitt, James O. Moore, and Robert P. Stewart.  In 1913, he was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly from Mecklenburg County.  Before moving to Charlotte, Stewart was superintendent of public instruction in Union County and served as principals of two schools.  He died in 1951.</p>

         <scopecontent>
            
            <p>The collection includes two ledgers and a small tablet.  The tablet contains an itemized list of the expenses he incurred while a student at Trinity College. The ledgers contain handwritten memoirs of Stewart's life.  Several pages in one ledger were removed prior to its donation to the Archives.  Handwritten on the inside of both covers of the ledger is "Stewart, McRae and Bobbitt, 400-404 Law Building, Charlotte, NC."  The removed pages may have contained information pertinent to the law firm and thus their removal.  On one of the pages in his ledger, Stewart wrote in 1931, "I sent the little book to Prof. R. L. Flowers to be placed in Archives of Duke University."  </p>

                     <extent>The original purpose of this ledger is unknown, but may have been intended for use in Stewart's law practice. In 1945, Stewart wrote his memoirs in the ledger.  He wrote about his birth, his childhood, going to school, going to college, practicing law, teaching and getting married.  He also wrote about his wife's death and his love for her.  Clipped inside the ledger is the 1896 commencement program for Marshville Academy, of which Stewart was principal.</extent>
