         <bioghist>
            
            <p>The Jarvis Residence Hall, named for former North Carolina Governor Thomas J. Jarvis, was considered to be cutting-edge in architectural design, adding great aesthetical value to Trinity College's campus (now the East Campus of Duke University). Like its nearby twin, Aycock Hall, Jarvis was built of white pressed brick and Indiana sandstone and roofed with green tile. When completed and occupied in October 1912, the building was three stories high and divided into five separate sections by solid firewalls extending from the ground to the roof. Jarvis had such amenities as a large social room, two complete kitchens, and a pressing room on each floor. Built to house 120 students, it was home to men from 1912 to 1930.  Jarvis Hall also housed the campus post office between 1912 and 1928. In 1930, the new West Campus opened and what had been the Trinity College campus (now East Campus) became the Woman's College of Duke University.</p>
            
            <p>
Jarvis House has been a non-selective women's residence hall since around 1930. In 1977, during an effort to equalize the balance of men and women on west campus, Housing Affairs administrators proposed to move residents of Jarvis Hall to housing blocks on West Campus. Jarvis residents protested the move and remained on East campus next to the Carr Building and West Duke Building.</p>
            
            <p>
As a residential unit, Jarvis House was at times governed by the Office of Student Affairs, Office of Housing Management, the Women's Student Government Association, the Residential Life Committee, the Community Council of the Woman's College, and the Association of Independent Houses.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <scopecontent>
            
            <p>Contains the records of Jarvis House, a residence hall for undergraduate female students at Duke University. Types of materials include correspondence, programming notes, reports, fliers, minutes, newsletters, photographs, rosters, song lyrics, scrapbooks, and financial records.  Major subjects include Trinity College history, Duke University history, women college students, student life, and general governance of residence halls. Materials range in date from 1946-1981, (bulk 1966-1977).  The three scrapbooks were created by Jarvis House residents. Because the original scrapbooks were in poor condition, items were removed and placed in archival folders for preservation. The scrapbook dated 1960-1961 is intact.</p>
