         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Committee (EEOC) was established by President Sanford in April 1970 to monitor the implantation of the University's Affirmative Action Plan.  The chair was Richard Bindewald, Executive Assistant to the Vice President for Business and Finance.  In the fall of 1969, the Vice President had established a compliance program, and Sanford's EEOC appears to be an extension or further development of that program.</p>
         
         <p>There were sixteen members, appointed by the President to the EEOC.  Individually the committee members were responsible for counsel with employees and supervisors to assist in handling verbal and formal (written) complaints of discrimination and to promote the advancement of minority group employees.  As a group the committee members were charged with regularly reviewing the University's Affirmative action plan in order to make recommendations and changes as well as monitor the Plan's implantation.  The committee was also responsible for submitting regular reports to the President on the status of the Affirmative Action Plan.</p>
         
         <p>An Equal Employment Opportunity Office was established in 1972.</p>
