         <p>The Residential College Task Force was created by President H. Keith H. Brodie in 1985 for the purpose of looking at the establishment of a new living option.  At the Task Force's first meeting, Brodie expressed his committment to the development of a residential college, noting that review of transfer students' reasons for leaving Duke indicated a desire for stable living arrangements which incorporate a community identity and a deeper intellectual life.  </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
