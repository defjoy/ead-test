         <p> Born in Whitesboro, Texas, John Leon Lievsay
		  (1906-1992) was educated at the University of Washington
		  (B.A., 1926; M.A., 1932; Ph.D., 1937). After teaching at
		  Stanford University and the University of Tennessee,
		  Lievsay came to Duke University in 1962 as a Professor of
		  English. He was a James B. Duke Professor of English from
		  1970 until his retirement in 1975.</p>
         
         <p>Lievsay's specialty was sixteenth and seventeenth
		  century literature, with an emphasis on Anglo-Italian
		  relations. He was a research fellow at the Huntington,
		  Newberry, and Folger Libraries, as well as a Fulbright
		  Fellow in Italy (1953-1954) and a Guggenheim Fellow
		  (1968-1969). Lievsay was a special consultant in Italian at
		  the Folger Library (1959-1960); chairman of the
		  Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies;
		  and a member of the Renaissance Society of America, the
		  Dante Society, and the American Association of Teachers of
		  Italian. </p>
         
         <p>Lievsay married Muriel M. Britten in 1926 and they
		  had one son, John Edward.</p>
