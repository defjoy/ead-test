         <p>Gwendolyn M. Parker is an author and memoirist whose work has
		  chronicled the experience of the black middle class in America. She was born in

		  Durham and lived in the Hay-Ti section of Durham until
		  <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1960</date> when she moved with her family to Connecticut. She
		  attended the
		  Kent School, a private boarding school, in
		  Connecticut, through high school and later attended Radcliffe. After graduating
		  from
		  Radcliffe in
		  <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1972,</date> Parker studied tax law at
		  New York University, graduating in
		  <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1975.</date> She then joined the Wall Street law firm of
		  Cadwalader, Wickersham, and Taft, leaving two
		  years later to become a tax lawyer with
		  American Express. While at
		  American Express she advanced to the position of
		  senior strategic analyst in the Office of Corporate Planning.</p>
         
         <p>Parker left
		  American Express in
		  <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1986</date> to devote herself to writing full-time. Her first
		  novel,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">These Same Long Bones, </title> was published in
		<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1994.</date> It is set in the segregated Hay-Ti section of Durham,
		North Carolina in the
		<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1940s.</date> Her memoir
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Trespassing: My Sojourn in the Halls of
		  Privilege</title> was published in
		<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1997</date> and chronicles her youth, college years, brief career
		with a Wall Street law firm, and her tenure with
		American Express. The book focuses on her struggles
		to earn a place in a corporate culture dominated by white males and her
		attempts to understand her position as a successful African American member of
		the middle class in the United States.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Gwendolyn M. Parker, which primarily document her
		  writing carreer, span the years 1967-1998 with the majority of the papers
		  dating from 1986-1997. They consist primarily of diaries, correspondence,
		  clippings, writings, and other miscellaneous printed and manuscript materials.
		  Parker's writings are well documented by several manuscript versions of her
		  1994 novel,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">These Same Long Bones,</title> and her 1997
		memoir,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Trespassing: My Sojourn in the Halls of Privilege.
		  </title> Parker's correspondence is chiefly professional and related to her
		efforts to publish for her work, but a small amount of personal correspondence
		is held in the collection. The clippings are primarily reviews of her books or
		published interviews. The personal observations, story ideas, and writing
		exercises recorded in Parker's diaries provide some documentation of her life
		and artistic career, chiefly after 1986.</p>

				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1983/1996" type="inclusive">1983-1996,</unitdate>chiefly the years
				after
				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate>when she left
				American Express and devoted herself to
				writing full time. The documentation of Parker's life provided by her diaries
				is somewhat sporadic. The diaries consist of records of her day to day
				activities, personal reflections, story ideas, writing exercises, poetry
				fragments, and records of her thoughts about her work and her insecurities as a
				writer. Many of the entries are loose typescript or handwritten pages that
				appear to have been removed from notebooks. The series is arranged
				chronologically, though some overlap in the dating may occur where a diary
				covers more than one year. Parker produced annotations to the diaries in
				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1998" type="inclusive">1998</unitdate>in order to provide
				contextual information.</p>

				Parker's personal relationships, efforts to publish her work, and her working
				relationships with her editor at
				Houghton Mifflin, 
                  Janet Silver, and her literary agent,
				Marie Brown. The earliest correspondence
				includes inter-office correspondence from
				American Express concerning Parker's promotion
				to senior strategic analyst in the Office of Corporate Planning. Also included
				in this series are her correspondence with friends and colleagues and rejection
				letters from publishers for early versions of
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">These Same Long Bones.</title> This novel is
			 often
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic"/> referred to in the correspondence as

			 prior to publication. The later correspondence, chiefly
			 <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1994" type="inclusive">1994</unitdate>-1997, includes letters
			 of congratulations from friends and colleagues concerning the publication of
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">These Same Long Bones,</title> letters from
			 children thanking her for presentations given at various schools, and letters
			 from fans of her work. The collection is chiefly composed of letters to Parker,
			 but it does include copies of several letters that Parker wrote to friends,
			 publishers, and other writers. Some of Parker's later correspondence was
			 written while she was living in southern
			 Africa in
			 <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1996" type="inclusive">1996</unitdate>and includes references to
			 her work on her memoir,

			 referred to in her letters by its working title,
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Slim Brown Face at the Table.</title> Parker
			 annotated several of the letters and these notes serve to provide some context
			 for the correspondence. The series is arranged chronologically.</p>

				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1988-1998,</unitdate>documents the

				includes Parker's
				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1998</unitdate>chronology of the
				writing of the novel, several early versions of the novel under its original
				title
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Hallowed Ground,</title> and notes and
				research related to the novel. It also includes drafts with revisions by both
				Parker and her editor at
				Houghton Mifflin, 
                     Janet Silver, page proofs with revisions by
				Parker and her copy editor at
				Houghton Mifflin, final page and cover design
				proofs, and promotional materials for both the hardback and paperback versions
				of the novel. Also included are the manuscripts for two unpublished short
				stories, "In The Flesh" and "Bittersweet," that were later developed into
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">These Same Long Bones.</title> Several of
				the working drafts of the novel are accompanied by Silver's cover letters
				offering suggestions, explanations for her revisions, and encouragement. The
				early working copies of this novel offer a vivid picture of Parker's creative
				process, and the revisions by her editors at
				Houghton Mifflin provide documentation of the
				editing process that helped to mold the manuscript into its final published
				form. This
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic"/> subseries also includes publicity
				materials used in the promotion of this book and two versions of Parker's
				unproduced screenplay based this novel. The subseries begins with Parker's
				chronology of the writing of this novel, and is arranged chronologically,
				thereunder alphabetically.</p>
