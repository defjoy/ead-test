         <p>Ruth Ann Hubbell was born in Smyth County, Virginia and grew up in western Virginia and
        North Carolina. She attended high school in Elkin, North Carolina. She received a B.A. from
        Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1919 and began teaching at the primary
        level. She returned to graduate study at Columbia University in New York, where she received
        a Master's in English in 1921. Then she studied psychology for a year at New York
        University. She taught briefly at Denton, Colorado; Appalchian State Teachers College,
        Boone, North Carolina; and Intermont, Virginia. She returned to New York and studied Library
        Science at New York City College, receiving a certificate in 1926. She then accepted a
        position in the Public Library in Washington, D.C. as Reference Assistant and Assistant
        Director of Adult Work. She remained there from 1926 to 1932, when she trasferred to the
        Northeast Branch as Reference Librarian. In 1939, she returned to the Central Library as
        Readers' Advisor in Literature where she worked for two years before going to the Georgetown
        Branch as Reference Librarian. At the time of her retirement in 1965, she was Reference
        Librarian and First Assistant in the Georgetown Branch. After retirement, she traveled
        extensively and was active in church and club work. She wrote a number of poems that were
        accepted for publication in numerous magazines. Copies of many of these poems were sent to
        her brother, Jay Broadus Hubbell, professor of literature at Duke University, and may be
        found in the biographical materials in the Jay B. Hubbell Papers in the Rubenstein Library
        at Duke.</p>

               <p>Contains mainly letters from Jay Broadus Hubbell to his sister Ruth Ann and their
            parents. Most of the parental letters are to Ruth Eller Hubbell, mother of Ruth Ann and
            her siblings, who after her husband's death in 1941 lived in Washington near Ruth Ann.
            Among the early letters are a few from Eller and Paul Hubbell, brothers of Ruth Ann and
            Jay Broadus, to Jay Broadus relating to their experiences and asking advice on courses
            to be taken as students at Fork Union Military Academy, Fork Union, Virginia. Letters
            from Ruth Ann to Jay Broadus are also present in the series. Although many of the
            letters discuss family concerns, Jay Broadus also tells of his writings, organizational
            work, and his teaching at Southern Methodist University, Duke University, Vienna,
            Athens, Columbia, Kentucky, Virginia, and Clemson universities. Jay Broadus discusses
            the differences between students in Vienna and Athens, comparing them to American
            students. Dispersed throughout the stationary letters are postcards and greetings cards.
            Clippings or photographs accompany some of the correspondence.</p>

               <p>Comprised of a single folder of varied and most often undated materials. A large
            proportion of the materials in this series are printed materials. These printed
            materials include information pamphlets for historical sites, museums, a convalescent
            center, and other institutions in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill, North Carolina, area
            as well as for sites on Duke University and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
            campuses. Advertising and marketing pamphlets for books written by or produced in honor
            of Jay B. Hubbell as well as a marketing pamphlet for a collection of poetry written by

            Writers' Conference held at the University of New Hamphire in 1947 and a 1978

            series. A 1925 Bulletin of Southern Methodist University announcing awards for the
            Fourth Annual Poetry Contest is also included. A business card for "Jay B. Hubbell,
            Ph.D., Professor of American Literature" completes the printed materials. A number of
            handwritten or hand-typed lists are also included in the series. Of potential research
            interest is a handwritten "List of Books by Jay B. Hubbell with others he owned or
