         <abstract>Collection comprises three provincial ballots (8.5"x17"), from the South African provinces of Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal, and the Western Cape. Instructions on how to fill out the form are provided in 11 languages, including English, Zulu, Afrikaans, Northern Sotho, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Tsonga, Swazi, Ndebele, and Venda. Ballots are printed in full color, with each of the 19 parties represented by a symbol, code, and party leader photograph. The Inkatha Freedom Party was a late entrant into the race, and its information was affixed via a sticker. During the election, each voter cast two votes via two separate ballots, one each for the national versus provincial elections. Voter's selected a party, not an individual candidate, to represent them in the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures. </abstract>
