         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Samuel W. Meek Papers span the years from 1917-1980, although the
		  bulk of the material dates from 1945-1962 and a few items are undated. Samuel
		  Meek served as Vice President in Charge of International Operations of the J.
		  Walter Thompson Company from 1930 to 1964. Working out of the New York office
		  as the head of the International Department, Meek established offices around
		  the world, provided continuing support and advice to the heads of these
		  international offices, made policy decisions related to international
		  operations, and served as a consultant to a number of U.S. government and
		  private agencies concerned with international relations and commerce. The
		  Series arrangement created by the J. Walter Thompson archivist reflects Meek's
		  activities and has been retained. Several categories of material are included:
		  correspondence, market surveys and research reports, letters, official
		  documents (such as the records of Meek's military service), and the transcripts
		  of talks.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="inof">International Offices Series,
			 1942-1964 and n.d</ref>. is comprised primarily of correspondence between
		  Samuel Meek and the heads of J. Walter Thompson's international offices. The
		  majority of the items relate to the offices in Vienna, Toronto, Paris, London,
		  Rome and Tokyo. The work of the offices in Denmark, Argentia, the Caribbean,
		  Greece, Holland, Mexico and Pakistan are less extensively documented. Market
		  surveys and research reports are also included. In addition to Samuel Meek,
		  correspondents include Robert M. Campbell, Wilfrid Sanders, Justin de Blank,
		  Kevin Farrell, Virgil D. Reed, Denys M. Scott, James H. Page, and Harry A. Lee.

         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="inde">International Department Series,
			 1930-1962 and undated</ref> is comprised of documents related to J. Walter
		  Thompson's role as an international advertising agency. Included are a 1957
		  personnel directory, letters outlining interational operations policy, and the
		  transcript of a 1961 interview with Stanley Resor related to the international
		  aspects of the company.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="inma">International Marketing Series,
			 1954-1962 and undated</ref>, includes correspondence with and reports from a
		  number of councils and agencies such as the Business Council for International
		  Understanding, the U.S. Information Agency, and the U.S. State Department.
		  Correspondence related to the planning of a Series of trade fairs, 1954-1961,
		  is also included. This material documents the role that the J. Walter Thompson
		  Company and other multinational businesses played in foreign relations in the
		  era of the Marshall Plan.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="inco">International Correspondents
			 Series, 1945-1962</ref>, includes correspondence and informal reports on
		  advertising conditions in various European and Middle Eastern countries.
		  Several of the items in this small collection seem to be preliminary
		  evaluations designed to help Samuel Meek decide whether conditions were
		  appropriate to the opening of a branch office in a particular locale. The
		  correspondents seem to be acquaintances of Meek or simply knowledgeable
		  individuals rather than J. Walter Thompson employees.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="pers">Personal Series, 1917-1979 and
			 undated</ref> is primarily concerned with Samuel Meek's personal life: records
		  of his military service, financial details of his retirement, his coat of arms,
		  and other issues. A few items of correspondence with James Webb Young and
		  information about Stanley B. Resor's death and the establishment of the Stanley
		  and Helen Resor Fund for Economic Research at Yale University are included.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="misc">Miscellaneous Series</ref>
		  includes several essays about advertising and a few other items.</p>

               <p>The
				International Offices Series spans the years
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1942-1964,</date> although the
				bulk of the material dates from
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1945-1960</date> and a few
				items are undated. The records consist of correspondence and documents of
				market research done at the
				 J. Walter Thompson offices outside the
				United States. The majority of the items
				relate to the offices in
				 Vienna, 
                  Toronto, 
                  Paris, 
                   London, 
                  Rome and
				Tokyo. The work of the office in
				 Denmark from
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1942-1962</date> and in
				Argentina, the
				 Caribbean, 
                  Greece, 
                  Holland, 
                   Mexico and
				Pakistan during
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1964-1966</date> is less
				extensively documented. The correspondence is primarily between
				 Samuel Meek,Vice President in charge of
				International Operations,
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1930-1964,</date> and the
				directors of the various branch offices. Most letters and telegrams focus on
				the practical aspects of establishing and running the
				offices in foreign countries: 
                  budgets, 
                  personnel issues, 
                  potential clients, 
                  competition from other advertising agencies, and

				market research. Others deal with the more
				personal aspects of a
				multi-national business: arranging gifts,
				meetings and receptions for visiting dignitaries, assisting executives of
				 J. Walter Thompson and of client companies
				with their travel plans, letters of condolence for the deaths of executives'
				family members, etc.</p>
               
               <p>A frequent topic of the correspondence is how to reduce
				xenophobia and to increase the acceptance of an
				American advertising agency and
				U.S. products in the face of the nationalistic
				climate in many of the relevant countries. During the
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1940s,</date> the
				London office was preoccupied with
				counteracting
				German anti-British propaganda in the
				 U.S.

               <p>The International Department Series is comprised of documents
				related to
				 J. Walter Thompson's employing an
				international advertising agency. A
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1957</date> personnel
				directory lists those employees of
				J. Walter Thompson with international
				backgrounds. The <emph render="doublequote"> Policy Letters</emph> file
				includes correspondence related to various international operations policy
				issues. Touched on here are the undesirability of an apprenticeship system,
				identifying optimal locations for agency offices, coordinating the
				international offices, volume discounts for
				advertisements, possible conflicts of interest in assuming a new client or
				product, training employees for foreign offices, producing
				speculative copy, principles of
				house advertising, how to handle
				unsolicited ideas, 
                  business ethics, and the
				creative process. The transcript of the
				<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1961</date> interview with
				Stanley Resor regards the international
				aspects of the agency. </p>
