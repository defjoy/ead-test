He received his legal training in Chapel Hill from William McCauley, then left Carolina in 1830.  He settles in Van Buren, Arkansas, in 1838, and was elected to the state legislature in the same year as a Whig party member.  He rose to prominence in state and national politics, and in 1861 he served as a delegate to the secession convention.  He married Rebecca Allen Turner in 1855; in 1856 they had a son, Jesse, who died at an early age in 1919, a few years after his mother.
