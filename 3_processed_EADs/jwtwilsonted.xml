         <abstract>The J. Walter Thompson
		  Company (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the oldest and largest enduring
		  advertising agencies in the United States. Ted Wilson was an executive at JWT
		  from 1947 to 1977. The Ted Wilson Papers span the years
		  1966-1977, and comprise correspondence, office files, client files, reports,
		  and speeches that document Wilson's career as an administrator coping with
		  JWT's financial difficulties resulting from the world-wide economic hardship of
		  the mid-1970s. In addition, the papers illustrate Wilson's involvement in the
		  reorganization of the company, as well as his management of several advertising
		  account teams, including the New Holland Machine Company and the Phillips
		  Petroleum Company. The papers mention a variety of JWT company operations,
		  including company programs such as Communispond (communications consulting),
		  while touching on a variety of social issues including the employment of
		  minorities and the Watergate affair.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Ted Wilson Papers</emph> span the years
		  1966-1977, and document Wilson's career as an executive for the J. Walter
		  Thompson Company (JWT). The papers comprise correspondence, office files,
		  client files, reports, and speeches that depict Wilson as a skillful
		  administrator coping with JWT's financial difficulties resulting from the
		  world-wide economic hardship of the mid-1970s. In addition, the papers
		  illustrate Wilson's involvement in the reorganization of the company, as well
		  as his management of several advertising account teams, including the New
		  Holland Machine Company and the Phillips Petroleum Company. The papers mention
		  a variety of JWT company operations, including company programs such as
		  Communispond, while touching on a variety of social issues including the
		  employment of minorities and the Watergate affair. There is no material in this
		  collection documenting the early years of Wilson's career or life after his
		  retirement in 1977. The collection also lacks materials dating from 1971
		  through mid-1973, the period during which Wilson worked in JWT's Chicago
		  Office. </p>
         
         <p>The collection is arranged in three series: <emph render="bold">Client
		  Files</emph>; <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, and
		  <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Client Files Series</emph> documents JWT's
		  relationship with numerous clients such as
		  Inter-Continental Hotels, Miles Laboratories, the New Holland
			 Machine Company, Pan American Airlines, Phillips Petroleum, the Radio
			 Corporation of America (RCA), Scott Paper Company and Squibb
			 Beech-Nut.
         </p>
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> chiefly consists
		  of outgoing letters and memos written by Wilson and his secretaries,
		  originating from Wilson's office in New York. The materials concern a broad
		  range of issues, including the reorganization of JWT, one of the most important
		  administrative tasks Wilson undertook during his presidency. </p>
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> pertains mainly
		  to various company operations, and consists of office files, primarily reports
		  and speeches, originating during the period when Wilson was Associate Manager
		  in JWT's New York Office. The papers illustrate Wilson's career as an
		  administrator as well as an advertising executive. Included are uncollated
		  Review Board records, dating from 1966, for various clients. </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Restrictions on access:</emph> Sensitive personnel
		  materials pertaining to individual employee matters are closed to non-JWT users
		  until 2045. In addition, Review Board records may be read, but cannot be
		  photocopied.</p>
         
         <p>Related materials within the JWT Archives include the
		  <emph render="bold">Accounts Files Collection</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Review Board Records</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Dan Seymour
		  Papers</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Don Johnston Papers</emph>. The
		  <emph render="bold">Biographical Information Files</emph> contain a folder for
		  Wilson consisting of news clippings and other materials.</p>

               <p>Consists of Wilson's letters, mostly dating from his years as
				President and Chairman of the Board, and touching on a variety of subjects,
				ranging from personal matters to company business to historical events such as
				the
				Watergate affair during
				Richard Nixon's presidency. The series
				contains a copy of Wilson's letter (April 22, 1974) in which he writes to a
				judge regarding
				Dwight Chapin, a former Nixon aide. The series
				also includes materials that reveal Wilson's views on the reorganization of the
				company, one of the most important administrative tasks Wilson undertook during
				his presidency. Materials in the series also depict Wilson as an advertising
				professional. For example, A memo to the Burger King account team, dated Aug.
				5, 1976, contains Wilson's suggestions that reflect his experience with
				advertising campaigns. In addition, materials such as Wilson's memo written on
				Nov. 4, 1975 highlight concerns over contemporary social issues including the
				employment of minorities. JWT attempted to expand its minority work force
				through company programs such as the Jobs Training Program, under which JWT
				hired and educated <emph render="doublequote">hard-core unemployable</emph>
				young minorities. Arranged chronologically. </p>
