         <p>Frederick Adolphus Wolf served as a James B. Duke
		  Professor of Botany at Duke University from 1927 until his
		  retirement in 1956. He was born in Odell, Nebraska in 1885,
		  and received his bachelor's degree (1907) and master's
		  degree (1908) from the University of Nebraska. After
		  teaching botany at the University of Texas for three years,
		  Wolf earned his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1911. </p>
         
         <p> His early career included plant pathology
		  research work at the Alabama Agricultural Experiment
		  Station and at the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment
		  Station. He joined the Botany faculty at Duke University in
		  1927. In 1965, he received the North Carolina Gold Medal,
		  the state's highest honor, which recognized him for his
		  research with tobacco. Two years later, the Kentucky
		  Commissioner of Agriculture honored Wolf for his
		  contributions to the tobacco industry. In 1968, Wolf was
		  given the Fellow Award of the Department of Plant Pathology
		  of the American Phytopathological Society, and in 1970, he
		  was named one of Tobacco's Men of the Year. </p>
         
         <p> Wolf's research focused on aromatic tobacco, and
		  he discovered that the aroma came from living hairs
		  covering both sides of the plant's leaves. He was a member
		  of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
		  the American Phytopathological Society, and the Botanical
		  Society of America. He authored numerous scholarly articles
		  and several books, including

		  their structure and classification</title> (1947),
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Tobacco Diseases and
		  Decays</title> (1957), and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Aromatic or Oriental
		  Tobaccos</title> (1962). Frederick Wolf died in 1975, at
		age 90.</p>
