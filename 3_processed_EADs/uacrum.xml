         <p>Educator, author, Methodist minister; born
		  Frederick Mason Crum; A.B. Wofford College, 1909; Ph.D.,
		  University of South Carolina, 1925; LI.D, 1950. Professor
		  of Biblical Literature, Duke University, 1930-1957. Author,

		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Gullah: Negro Life in the
		  Carolina Sea Islands</title> (1940);
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Negro in the Methodist
		  Church</title> (1950). Married (1914) Katherine Howell of
		Waterboro, S.C.; six children. </p>
         
         <p> Mason Crum was born in Rowesville, S.C., the son
		  of William C. and Nonie (Neeley) Crum. His father was a
		  merchant, farmer, and landowner in Orangeburg County. Crum
		  received his undergraduate education at Wofford College,
		  Spartanburg, graduating in 1909. He then attended the
		  School of Religion at Vanderbilt in 1910, and was principal
		  of a school in Fort Mill, S.C. for a year. In 1911,
		  desiring to work for a Ph.D. in order to teach at the
		  college level, he entered Harvard for courses in psychology
		  and philosophy. After a year's study, he returned to South
		  Carolina and began what his autobiography calls a kind of
		  detour in life. During the few next years, he worked as an
		  agent for the Department of Agriculture, sold cars, and
		  became interested in the ministry. He was ordained in the
		  Methodist Church in 1919 and received a pastorate in
		  Summerville, S.C. in 1920. Still desiring to teach, he was
		  appointed Professor of Religious Education at Columbia
		  College. From 1920 to 1930 he taught courses in Biblical
		  literature, psychology, ethics, and education, and
		  completed the Ph.D. program in education at the University
		  of South Carolina, receiving the degree in 1925; his
		  dissertation was on the Project Principle in Religious
		  Education. He was a member and officer of the Chi Phi
		  fraternity. </p>
         
         <p> He began teaching Biblical Literature part-time
		  at Duke University in 1930, and was appointed to the
		  faculty two years later. While at Duke, Crum worked
		  extensively on the question of race relations and
		  Christianity and began studying the social history of the
		  South Carolina Sea Islands, and especially the Gullah
		  communities on Edisto and St. Helena. He took part in
		  cooperative efforts in bettering race relations through
		  education, and was active in a number of organizations. He
		  began teaching a course in Black History, The Negro in the
		  Religious Life of America, in 1954; the course was
		  described as an examination of Christian churches' attempts
		  to apply the Christian ethic to race relations, although
		  Crum intended it as a course about Black life and culture.
		  Crum retired from Duke in 1957, and, after moving to
		  Florida, he volunteered his services as a pastoral
		  counselor to a clinic associated with the Presbyterian
		  Church of Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife returned to
		  North Carolina sometime after 1963, and took up residence
		  at Lake Junaluska, the Methodist Church's retreat in
		  western North Carolina, where Crum died in September, 1980.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Mason Crum papers include correspondence,
		  printed material, hand written and typewritten manuscripts
		  of books and articles, clippings, photographs and glass
		  slides, and an audio tape, with the bulk dates being
		  1931-1959. Crum acquired the materials over the course of
		  his career as a professor of Biblical literature who had
		  interests in Black history, psychology, race relations, and
		  recent Methodist church history. His major area of research
		  was the Gullah communities of Edisto and St. Helena, two of
		  the South Carolina Sea Islands, with the bulk of work here
		  dating from the 1930s; the result of the research was
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Gullah</title>, published by
		Duke University Press in 1940. Other areas of interest were
		moral education, pastoral counseling, and religious
		pageantry. His concern with Christianity and race relations
		is shown by his participation in cooperative efforts, and
		in the teaching of one of the first Black studies courses
		in the South (1954). </p>

               <p>62 10" x 13" black and white prints, many
				autographed and dated by Mason Crum, mounted on 15" x 20"
				boards, in two volumes, and numbered; plus one box of
				snapshots, lantern slides, magazine clippings and small
				mounted prints. Most of the mounted prints date from
				1935-1936, and are landscapes, portraits, buildings and
				activities in the Gullah communities on the islands of
				Edisto and St. Helena's; also photographs of charcoal
				portraits done in the Sea Islands by Winold Reiss of St.
				Helena, family prints and portraits, and prints of old
				maps. Most of the remaining photographs are family
				snapshots, scenes at Lake Junaluska, small prints of the
				Sea Island photographs, approximately 48 3" x 4" glass
				lantern slides of Sea Island prints, and scenes at Duke
				University (including 5" x 7" prints for an article titled
