         <abstract>Documentary photographer based in New York State. The color images in the Jonathan Hyman Photographs collection were taken by Hyman from 2002 to 2011, and portray vernacular memorials and other forms of public remembering that express anger, sadness and patriotic emotions following the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon. Images take the form of graphic art, signs, sculpture, body art, and graffiti. Iconic elements include the U.S. flag, eagles, and the Twin Towers.  Canvases for these forms of expression include clothing, buildings, vehicles, and tombstones. Most of the 33 large 20x24" inkjet prints were featured in Duke University exhibit Flesh &amp; Metal, Bodies &amp; Buildings: Works from Jonathan Hyman's Archive of 9/11 Vernacular Memorials, curated by Pedro Lasch. The exhibit was on display in the Rubenstein Photography Gallery from 9 May-16 October 2011.  Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Photographer and Bethel, New York resident Jonathan Hyman graduated from Rutgers University where he was a Henry Rutgers Scholar. He holds a Master of Fine Arts degree from Hunter College and is best known for his ongoing documentary work surrounding the September 11th attacks. From the very day of the 9/11 attacks, Hyman has been photographing the vernacular artwork created by Americans on the side of the road and in public places in response to the attacks, as well as recording hundreds of oral histories. Hyman is also Associate Director for Conflict and Visual Culture initiatives at the Solomon Asch Center for Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.</p>
         
         <p>To mark the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks, Hyman’s work was featured in two museum exhibitions. The first, at Ground Zero in New York City, titled, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">9/11 and the American Landscape: Photographs by Jonathan Hyman,</title> was the first public programming organized by the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. The second exhibit, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">9/11: A Nation Remembers,</title> featuring 100 photographs, was at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. On the tenth anniversary of the attacks Hyman’s photographs will be exhibited in Duke University’s Special Collections Library and published by the University of Texas Press as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Photographer’s Journey: The Landscape of 9/11</title>.</p>
         
         <p>Hyman’s photographs have been featured in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Time</title> magazine, as well as many national and international publications. Beyond his well-known work on September 11 memorials, his areas of interest and expertise as a photographer fall under the rubric of <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Things Found on The Side of The Road,</title> and they include: public memory, memorialization and speech, social class issues and visual public discourse, roadside commerce, urban street art, rural vernacular roadside art, and environmental concerns. </p>
