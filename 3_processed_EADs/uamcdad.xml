         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Angus McDougall was born in Oxford, England.  He studied sculpture in Boston, Massachusetts during the 1920s, and later in Italy.  Eventually he returned to England to study drawing and architecture, and where he enrolled in the Royal College of Art’s Sculpture School.  In 1938, he returned to the U.S. and served as a designer for Steuben Glass, Inc. and as advertising manager at Creative Age Press.  He later moved to Durham, N.C., where he taught sculpture and made portrait heads on commission.</p>
