         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>David Goldblatt was born November 29, 1930 in the South African city Randfontein of the province Gauteng. His photographic career began at age eighteen when he began taking pictures. With parents and grandparents who fled Lithuania around 1890 to escape from religious persecution against Jews, Goldblatt found himself simultaneously a part of white society that saw itself as superior, and an object of racial and religious oppression; this may explain in part the subjects of his images, which explore and document the complexities of a particular historical moment in South Africa. Goldblatt was drawn to the gold mines near his hometown, which he photographed primarily in black and white; later, in the 1990s, he began to explore color photography. Besides contributing to many photographic exhibitions, Goldblatt has published many books, and has also produced films created from his still images.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Collection of 251 silver bromide black and white photographic prints taken by David Goldblatt in South Africa during the late 1960s, as well as copies of three 16 mm films, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Soweto</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">On the Mines</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Some Afrikaners</title>, created in 1976 from his still images. Goldblatt captured the photographic images in different regions of South Africa, traveling from his hometown west of Johannesburg to the Western Cape province and the Karoo. DVD viewing copies are available for these films. The photographs in this collection were published in Goldblatt's first two books: <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">On The Mines</title> (1973, with Nadine Gordimer) and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Some Afrikaners Photographed</title> (1975). The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">On the Mines</ref> series, from the late 1960s, features images of both white and black South African gold miners, in groups and individually, both inside and outside the mines. The images in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Some Afrikaners</ref> series, shot from 1961 to 1968, depict the everyday life of white South Africans, known as Afrikaners, and the environment in which they live. Subjects include school, recreation, mealtimes, buildings, decorum and dress; there are group pictures as well as individual portraits. Print sizes vary, with 8x10 inch prints, uncropped work prints of custom sizes and shapes on paper no larger than approximately 12 1/2 x 12 1/2 inches, and prints mounted on 12 1/2 x 13 inch tan matte boards. Most have notes with printing instructions, with occasional captions on backs of prints or beneath prints on matte boards. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts, Duke University.</p>
