         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of British-born Norman A. Hutchings span the years 1939-1946, and document Hutchings' experiences during World War II serving aboard several ships in the British Royal Navy. Norman Hutchings entered the Navy in 1941 and received his training on board H.M.S. Collinwood. He then served as a signalman on board the destroyer, H.M.S. Faulknor, which was involved in the Battle of the Atlantic against German submarines that preyed on British merchant ships. In 1943, Hutchings posted to the naval headquarters at Fort St. Angelo on Malta. The collection consists of 488 items gathered by Hutchings during his World War II experience, and include correspondence, diaries, newspaper clippings, photographs, theater programs and ticket stubs, and other personal notes and ephemera. The materials are arranged in groups by format: Clippings, Correspondence, Diaries, Ephemera, Naval Messages, and Photographs. The correspondence is primarily between Norman and his wife, Iris, but there are other exchanges with family members and friends. While the correspondence mainly details Hutchings's family home life, the seven small diaries, with daily entries written in very tiny handwriting, contain descriptions of civilian life during the Battle of Britain, as well as detailed accounts of shipboard life on the H.M.S. Faulknor and dated events such as German bombing raids in Britain. Acquired as part of the William B. Hamilton Collection of British Manuscripts.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

                  <p>Consists of seven diaries, each in its own envelope, with the envelopes inside two folders. The diary from 1940 provides descriptions of air raids on Britain by the Germans. The diaries from 1941 through 1945 provide details of life aboard the destroyer, H.M.S. Faulknor, in the Atlantic, as well as Hutchings's time in Malta. The diary for 1942 is very fragile; please handle with care. Arranged chronologically.</p>
