         <abstract>A native of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, Margaret Taylor Smith attended Duke University from 1943-1947. After graduating with a degree in sociology, Smith and her husband relocated to Birmingham, Michigan. Smith raised four children while taking an active part in her community through volunteer work and leadership. Smith's work as a research associate studying family life became the basis for a 1987 book, Mother, I Have Something to Tell You. Smith served as the chair of the Board of Trustees of the Kresge Foundation, a national organization that awards grants to support non-profit organizations. In addition, Smith continues her commitment to Duke University by holding leadership positions on multiple boards, by acting as a founding member and chair of the Council on Women's Studies, and by enabling the creation of the Sarah W. and George N. Taylor Endowment Fund for women's leadership and the Margaret Taylor Smith Endowed Directorship for Women's Studies. The Margaret Taylor Smith Papers contain materials dating from 1918 to 2010, with the bulk dating between 1980 and 2008. The collection documents Smith's voluntarism, leadership, and philanthropic activities at Duke University, especially in women's studies; her sociological research on American families, specifically relationships between mothers and children, that resulted in the publication of a book, Mother I Have Something To Tell You; her social and family life; and her professional activities and voluntarism, particularly at the Kresge Foundation. The collection is organized into five series: Duke University, Mother, I Have Something To Tell You, Personal Papers, Professional Voluntarism, and Additions.</abstract>

         <p>A native of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, Margaret Taylor Smith attended Duke University from 1943-1947. After graduating with a degree in Sociology, Smith and her husband relocated to Birmingham, Michigan. Smith raised four children while taking an active part in her community through volunteer work and leadership. Smith was instrumental in founding the Legal Aid Society to provide legal assistance for low income citizens, and New Horizons, Inc. to provide service to individuals with disabilities. She held leadership roles in the Girl Scouts and the Junior League and participated in organizations designed to support children. Smith worked as a research associate at the Merrill-Palmer Institute of Wayne State University, studying family life and early childhood development. Her research became the basis for a 1987 book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Mother, I Have Something to Tell You</title>. Smith served as the chair of the Board of Trustees of the Kresge Foundation, a national organization that awards grants to support non-profit organizations.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Margaret Taylor Smith Papers contain materials dating from 1918 to 2010, with the bulk dating between 1980 and 2008. The collection documents Smith's voluntarism, leadership, and philanthropic activities at Duke University, especially in women's studies; her sociological research that resulted in the publication of a book; her social and family life; and her professional activities and voluntarism, particularly at the Kresge Foundation. Smith's original folder titles were retained. Smith, an avid note taker, often recorded information on the exterior of folders and manila envelopes. These folders were retained and appear in the collection. The collection is organized into five series: <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Duke University</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">

         <p>The <emph render="bold">Duke University Series</emph> comprises materials related to Smith's leadership and professional voluntarism at the university, including correspondence, event planning notes, meeting minutes, endowment information, and speeches.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">
               
               <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Mother, I Have Something To Tell You</title> Series</emph> documents the publication of the 1987 book, authored by Jo Brans, based on Smith's sociological research that describes how mothers deal with children who display untraditional behavior. Specifically, Smith researched American families whose children challenged social and sexual mores during the 1960s and 1970s. The series contains correspondence, drafts, speeches, and Smith's research related to the book, including the mothers' subject files, which typically contain written transcripts of Smith's interviews with the women, both with and without Smith's notes, questionnaires and sociological data, and audiocassette recordings of the interviews. Original audio recordings are closed to research. Use copies need to be created before contents can be accessed.</p>
         
         <p>Materials related to Smith's social and family life are located in the <emph render="bold">Personal Papers Series</emph>, which primarily comprises correspondence with family, friends, and some professional associates, but also includes photographs, newspaper clippings, ephemera from Smith's days as an undergraduate at Duke University, and her father's World War I diary.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Voluntarism Series</emph> contains materials documenting Smith's professional activities, including awards, correspondence, speaking engagements, subject files, voluntarism, and philanthropy. The series particularly highlights Smith's work as the chair of the Board of Trustees of the Kresge Foundation, a national organization that awards grants to support non-profit organizations; her volunteer work with the Junior League; and her interest in ethics and ethical dilemmas.</p>
         
         <p>Later <emph render="bold">Additions</emph> have not been processed. Accession (2010-0066) contains email correspondence.

               <p>As a highly involved Duke undergraduate, Smith served as president of Woman's College student government while excelling in scholarship (Phi Beta Kappa), athletics (Delta Phi Rho Alpha), and in leadership (Phi Kappa Delta, White Duchy, Pi Beta Phi). After earning a degree in Sociology in 1947, Smith continued her commitment to the university through leadership, volunteering, and philanthropy. Smith served on the Executive Committee for Duke's Capital Campaign Fund drive, on the Board of Directors of the General Alumni Association, as a member and chair of Trinity College's Board of Visitors, and on the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of Duke's National Council. Particularly interested in women's issues, Smith was a founding member and chair of the Council on Women's Studies and served as president of the Women's Alumnae Association. Smith's generosity enabled the creation of the Sarah W. and George N. Taylor Endowment Fund for women's leadership and the Margaret Taylor Smith Endowed Directorship for Women's Studies. The series also documents the relationship between Smith and Jean O'Barr, who established the Women's Studies Program. Personal correspondence between the two women appears in the Personal Papers Series. The alphabetically arranged Duke University Series comprises materials related to Smith's leadership and professional voluntarism at the university, including correspondence, event planning notes, meeting minutes, endowment information, and speeches. Materials documenting Smith's experiences as an undergraduate at Duke and her social activities related to the university can be found in the Personal Papers Series.</p>

               <p>In the early 1980s, Smith worked as a research associate at the Merrill-Palmer Institute of Wayne State University, studying family life and early childhood development. Smith collaborated with writer Jo Brans to publish the book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Mother, I Have Something To Tell You</title> in 1987. Based on interviews with mothers in Michigan, the book describes how parents deal with children who display untraditional behavior. Specifically, Smith researched families whose children challenged social and sexual mores during the 1960s and 1970s. The series contains correspondence, drafts, speeches, and Smith's sociological research related to the book, in addition to files on each mother, who appeared in the book under aliases provided by Brans. In keeping with the anonymity provided by the book, file names reflect aliases rather than real names. The mothers' subject files include written transcripts of Smith's interviews with the women, both with and without Smith's notes, questionnaires and sociological data, and audiocassette recordings of the interviews. Arrangement is alphabetical, followed by a large group of research files organized into rough book chapters by Smith.</p>
