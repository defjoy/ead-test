         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>Produced mostly by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio of China, documentary films and newsreels were two of the major mass media and communication channels in China from the 1950s through 1970s. They covered all aspects of social activities, though the emphasis was on developments and achievements in the building of a socialist country. In order to reach even broader public audiences, government agents produced and printed the transcripts and shot lists for the films and sent them to cities and rural areas. Few of these printed materials have survived due to the poor quality of the paper upon which they were printed. The material in this collection was found in a cinema company office in Henan province, China.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection of film advertisements and transcripts of Chinese documentary films and newsreels spans the years 1946 to 1985, although the bulk of the items in the collection are transcripts for the documentary films and newsreels from the
      Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976.  It should also be noted that the dating of the 1946 item is questionable. All documents in the collection are in Chinese. The collection is arranged into the following series:  <emph render="bold">Advertisements and Film Description Series, 1953-1966 and undated; Documentary and Newsreel Scripts Series, 1946 (?)-1985 and undated; Feature Filmscripts Series, undated;</emph> and <emph render="bold">Newspaper Clipping Scrapbook Series, 1950-1959 and undated.</emph> Topics include industry, agriculture, the economy, military matters, education, public health care, medicine and science, as well as political movements, foreign relations, cultural and sporting events. Most of the documentary filmscripts are short, focusing on a specific subject or event, whereas newsreel scripts are numbered sequentially within each year and cover multiple topics or events. During the Cultural Revolution, documentary films and newsreels were powerful and popular propaganda tools for patriotism, nationalism,
      Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and socialist construction, and served political purposes.</p>
         
         <p>In this collection, there is also a group of printed advertisements and other publicity for Chinese and foreign films, plays, opera, and local performances. This collection is valuable for studies of contemporary Chinese culture, the Cultural Revolution, history and politics, communist propaganda, and mass media.
</p>
         
         <p>The collection was microfilmed for broader access in 2006, and the original master copies of the microfilm are in the final box of the collection.</p>

            discussion questions. Also includes some posters, performance schedules and

            These focus on specific subjects, events or personal stories. Scripts in boxes
            2 and 3 are arranged by subject, then chronologically within each subject. The
            date on the earliest item in box 3 is questionable. There are also a few
            special issues. For example, a special issue in February 1966 is entitled:

            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Chairman Mao’s Good Student- Jiao Yulu.</title> Scripts for Xin Wen Jian Bao in box 4
