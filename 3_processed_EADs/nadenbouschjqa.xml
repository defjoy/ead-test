The collection contains material relating to the operation of flour mills by John Q. A. Nadenbousch before the Civil War; the constitution of the Berkeley Border Guards formed in Berkeley County, Virginia, in 1859, and items relating to the subsequent service of that unit in the Civil War as a company of the 2nd Virginia Regiment, including letters of General Thomas Jonathan Jackson to his officers, commissary accounts, muster rolls, provost marshal records, and a manuscript draft of a report by John Q. A. Nadenbousch as colonel of the 2nd Virginia Regiment describing the experiences of that regiment in the fight at Culp's Hill, July 2, 1863, during the battle of Gettysburg; correspondence of John Q. A. Nadenbousch as agent of the Hannis Distilling Company of Baltimore, Maryland, engaged in the operation of a distillery at Martinsburg, West Virginia; letters relating to the management of the Grand Central Hotel in Martinsburg, 1878; and letters concerning John Q. A. Nadenbousch's general financial condition after the Civil War. Papers of Alexander Parks, Jr., concern his position as local agent for Hannis Distilling Company in Martinsburg after 1874; his participation in civic affairs in Martinsburg; and his work in the Democratic Party, including his election to the state senate of West Virginia in 1890. Papers of John Nadenbousch Parks, son of Alexander Parks, Jr., include letters to his family while he was a student at Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Virginia, 1893, and letters, 1917, to John N. Parks while he was a member of the legislature of West Virginia. Letters, 1895, of Elise Parks, daughter of Alexander Parks, Jr., concern her life as a student at Virginia Female Institute, Staunton, Virginia. Volumes in the collection include a treasurer's notebook, 1852, of a local lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows; a sheriff's account book, 1825-1841, from Jefferson County, West Virginia; an account of tax levies in Jefferson County; a ledger of John Q. A. Nadenbousch, 1872-1878; and notes and accounts of the Berkeley County Agricultural and Mechanical Association.</p>
