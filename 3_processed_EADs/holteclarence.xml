         <abstract>Resident of Harlem, N.Y., advertising executive, and bibliofile. Collection comprises one spiral-bound portfolio (21 pgs.) containing clippings, drawings, and typewritten notes, intended as a prospectus for a proposed new magazine supplement targeted at African Americans, to be carried in newspapers nationwide. In the prospectus, Holte explained the historical role played by African American newspapers in their community, as well as economic growth that made them stable consumers and an attractive targeted market. The advertising opportunity was directed at Lever Brothers Company. Includes 5 pages of correspondence between Holte, Lever Brothers, and THIS WEEK MAGAZINE, all laid-in at the end of the prospectus, that made it clear that Holte's proposal was rejected. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising &amp; Marketing History. </abstract>
