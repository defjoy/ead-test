         <p>A group of Law School students formed the bipartisan Nixon Portrait Committee to raise funds for a portrait of President Richard Nixon, a 1937 graduate of the School.  The Committee was chaired by Charles S. Mill, Jr., a student in the Duke Law School.  The portrait was painted by Joseph Wallace King and was presented to the Law School at the 1969 Commencement ceremony.  Since that time it has been stored in the Law School and the Art Museum.  In March of 1998, there were plans to loan the portrait in turn to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Nixon Library, and the National Portrait Gallery.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
