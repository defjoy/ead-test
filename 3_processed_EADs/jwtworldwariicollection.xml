         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>In April 1941 
		  Stanley B. Resor, then president of the J. Walter
		  Thompson Company (JWT), outlined the advertising industry's role in the coming
		  conflict. In an article published in New York City Sunday newspapers, he spoke
		  of advertising agencies' two goals: to keep consumers purchasing goods in order
		  to help offset war expenses, and to relate the <emph render="doublequote">truths</emph> behind the government's policies and
		  programs. </p>
         
         <p>The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) contributed to the war effort
		  during World War II in two ways: by creating ads supporting government
		  policies, and by granting its employees time off for their own war work. JWT's
		  government accounts included the War Manpower Commission, handled by 
		  Helen Lansdowne Resor and James Webb Young; the
		  Naval Aviation Cadet program, handled by 
		  Sam Meek; Woman Power, handled by 
		  William E. Berchtold; and the U.S. Cadet Nurse
		  Corps, developed by 
		  Ruth Waldo and handled by 
		  Thayer Jaccaci. In each of these accounts, as in
		  most campaigns formulated for the government, sponsors in private industry were
		  sought. For instance, advertisements for the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps were
		  sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Company. In addition to the sponsorship of
		  government advertising programs, clients adjusted their own campaigns to
		  reflect America's war-time conditions. Advertising campaigns were also
		  formulated for religious and charitable organizations. Both the British War
		  Relief Society and the Navy Relief Society benefitted from the advertising
		  expertise of J. Walter Thompson Company personnel. International offices of the
		  Company became involved in a number of ways. The London Office, for example,
		  prepared a conservation program for the Ministry of Food, while the Australian
		  Office implemented an Australian-American goodwill campaign. </p>
         
         <p> Company personnel were granted leaves of absence or time for civilian
		  work of importance to the war. Among these were James Webb Young, chair of the
		  War Advertising Council, tyhe predecessor to the Advertising Council; Samuel W.
		  Meek, consultant to the Navy Department; and Walter O'Meara, Deputy
		  Administrator for Information, Office of Price Administration. Those who
		  remained in the office devoted some of their time and talent to aiding such
		  organizations as the Camp Shows for Service Men, the Citizen United for
		  Democracy, and the National War Fund.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The J. Walter Thompson Company World War II Advertising Collection
		  documents the war-related activities of the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT)
		  advertising agency during 1940-1948, including a few post-war assessments. In
		  particular, it shows JWT’s contributions to the war effort by its in-house
		  documentation and work on government, civilian, and war-supporting charitable
		  organization accounts. Materials include lists, memos, press releases,
		  correspondence, notes, and advertisement tearsheets and proofs. Many of the
		  materials in this collection are products of campaigns conducted under the
		  auspices of the War Advertising Council, as well as those sponsored by civilian
		  clients. These advertisements and pamphlets supported food rationing, fuel and
		  rubber conservation, the purchase of War Bonds, the United Services
		  Organization (USO), military recruitment, and women's employment in war-related
		  jobs. Other advertisements arose from JWT's work in 1941 and 1942 for the Navy
		  Relief Society. Items produced by the JWT London Office supported British War
		  Relief (Ministry of Food, 1940-1941) and the Food Facts series (recipes and
		  cooking tips for foods available despite rationing). </p>
         
         <p>The collection includes corporate-sponsored advertisements relating to
		  the war effort. Companies represented include: the 
		  American Association of Playing Card Manufacturers
		  (recreation for convalescent service-men, in cooperation with the 
		  Red Cross); 
		  Anthracite Industries, Inc. (fuel conservation); 
		  Eastman Kodak Company 
            (U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps); and the 
		  Institute of Life Insurance  (ads to fight
		  inflation produced in cooperation with the 
		  Office of Economic Stabilization, and a
		  <emph render="doublequote">Keep Well</emph> campaign). Other advertisements
		  were backed by 
		  Lambert Pharmacal Co. (women's employment); 
		  Libbey Glass Company (recruitment of women Marines
		  and nurses' aides); 
		  National Retail Dry Goods Association (nurse
		  recruitment); 
		  Owens Illinois-Glass Company (paper salvage); 
		  Petroleum Industry War Council (campaigns for
		  saving tires, rubber, and gasoline); 
		  Shell Oil Company and other petroleum and rubber
		  companies (salvage of scarce materials); and 
		  Textron (nurse recruitment).</p>
         
         <p>Related materials may be found elsewhere in the J. Walter Thompson Co.
		  Archives, including the papers of JWT executives such as Samuel W. Meek, Walter
		  O'Meara, Helen Lansdowne Resor, Stanley Burnet Resor, Ruth F. Waldo and James
		  Webb Young. Similar materials may also be found in the R.C. Maxwell Company
		  Outdoor Advertising Archives; the War Effort Mobilization Campaigns Poster
		  Collection; and the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA)
		  Archives.</p>
