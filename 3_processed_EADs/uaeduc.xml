         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>By the charter of 1851, graduates of Normal
		  College (the precursor to Trinity College) were recognized
		  by the North Carolina legislature as qualified to teach in
		  the common schools of the state. In 1859, President Braxton
		  Craven introduced a teacher training curriculum. The
		  Department of Education was formed at Trinity College in
		  1907, and teacher training programs, particularly those
		  offered during the summer, enrolled many students. Prior to
		  1952, most students preparing to teach in the secondary
		  schools majored in education. During the 1950s, this began
		  to change; students could major in the subject they planned
		  to teach, and be advised by members of the Department of
		  Education. In 1954, a program leading to the degree of
		  Master of Arts in Teaching was started, and throughout the
		  1950s, a number of special and cooperative programs were
		  established. The 1960s saw an increase in the number of
		  students seeking graduate training. By the late 1970s, the
		  number of undergraduates intending to teach had begun to
		  decline. The department was eliminated December 31, 1981
		  and replaced by a Program in Education in the College of
		  Arts and Sciences, which enables undergraduates to meet
		  state certification requirements. The Master of Arts in
		  Teaching Degree continues to be offered.</p>
