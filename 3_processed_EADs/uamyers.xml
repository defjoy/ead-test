         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Hiram Earl Myers was a clergyman, theologian, and
		  educator. Born in Anson County, near Wadesboro, N.C., in
		  1889, Myers attended Trinity College (A.B., 1911), Boston
		  University School of Theology (S.T.B., 1920; S.T.M., 1926),
		  University of Chicago and Chicago Theological Seminary
		  (1936), Harvard Divinity School and the Episcopal
		  Theological Seminary (1941). He received an honorary Doctor
		  of Divinity degree from Elon College (1950).</p>
         
         <p>Myers was ordained as a minister in the Methodist
		  Episcopal Church, South (1918) and served as pastor of the
		  Trinity Methodist Church in Manchester, N.H. while
		  attending Boston University. He also served at N.C.
		  churches located in Graham, Salisbury, Elizabeth City, and
		  Durham. </p>
         
         <p>Myers joined the Duke University faculty in 1926
		  as professor of biblical literature. He served as Chairman
		  of the Department of Religion (1934-1936) and as Director
		  of Undergraduate Studies in Religion (1937-1957). Myers
		  stayed at Duke until his retirement in 1958.</p>
         
         <p>Myers was involved in a number of professional,
		  civic, church, and honorary organizations including the
		  National Association of Biblical Instructors, the American
		  Association of University Professors, and Phi Beta
		  Kappa.</p>
         
         <p>Myers married Rose Mae Warren in 1926. They had
		  one daughter, Martha Rose.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection reflects Myers' activities as a
		  clergyman and his thoughts on theological issues. The
		  collection consists of correspondence; texts of sermons and
		  Sunday School lessons; prayers given in Duke Chapel;
		  records of sermons, baptisms, and marriages; notes on sermon topics;
		  pamphlets; and other printed material. Major subjects
		  include Myers' activities as a clergyman, his reflections
		  on theological issues, and his involvement in the Methodist
		  Episcopal Church, South. </p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Writings and Speeches</ref> Series
		  is an important part of the collection. It includes the
		  typed and manuscript texts of approximately three hundred
		  sermons and Sunday School lessons given by Myers throughout
		  his career as a minister, prayers used in Duke Chapel, and
		  other writings.</p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Correspondence</ref> Series
		  includes correspondence with colleagues and family.
		  Individual items of particular interest are letters from
		  R.L. Flowers dealing with the aftermath of the deaths of
		  James B. Duke and William Preston Few. Other correspondents
		  include Sarah Pearson Duke, Josephus Daniels, Horace R.
		  Kornegay, Sam J. Ervin, Jr., Y.E. Smith, William A. Erwin,
		  and William B. Umstead. A few items within the
		  correspondence deal with local Methodist affairs in the
		  N.C. conference, particularly with ministerial
		  appointments. Most of the correspondence is routine,
		  although it occasionally reflects historical events such as
		  the Great Depression and World War II.</p>
         
         <p>Other series in the collection include
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Personal and Family Papers</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">Pastoral Records</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Lake Junaluska</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Duke University</ref>, and
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7">Subject Files</ref>. </p>
         
         <p>Material directly related to Duke University is
		  scanty. There are three folders of tests and examinations
		  administered by Myers in his classes. Individual items of
		  interest include Myers' reminiscences at the the 1960
		  alumni reunion and a copy of a poetic tribute to B. N. Duke
		  by Wilbur F. Tillett of Vanderbilt University in 1928.</p>
