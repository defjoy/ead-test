         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>For twenty years, James Luther Kibler was a public school teacher, and in 1898 was the prime mover in the organization of the Virginia Teachers Co-operative League, the progenitor of the Virginia Education Association. In 1899 he married Henrietta Shipe of Fort Valley, Virginia. Their children were James Otto and Orpha Evangeline.  Kibler was a prominent Lutheran layman and a Democrat until he broke with the party in 1932 and joined the Socialist Party.  In 1933 he ran on that party's ticket for the Lieutenant-governorship of Virginia, but was defeated.  From 1934 to 1936 he was Secretary-Treasurer of the Socialist Party of Virginia. He was drafted by the party to run for the U.S. Senate in 1936 but was compelled to withdraw from the race.</p>
         
         <p>After his school teaching days, he was active chiefly as a journalist and historian.  From 1930 to 1935, he wrote <emph render="doublequote">Kibler's Kolumn</emph> for the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Virginia Gazette</title>. He was also the author of several volumes and numerous articles, other than his <emph render="doublequote">Kolumn.</emph>  For some years he was active in the Federal Writer's Project.  He also was connected with <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Subsequent History</title> and more than one guide service that conducted tours of Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown.
