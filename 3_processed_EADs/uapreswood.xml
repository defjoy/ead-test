         <abstract>Marquis Lafayette Wood was a Methodist
		  clergyman, missionary, and educator. He served as President
		  of Trinity College (Randolph County, N.C.) from 1883 to
		  1884. The Marquis Lafayette Wood Records and Papers
		  primarily consist of diaries, sermons and addresses, with a
		  small amount of correspondence, minutes, account books, and
		  writings. Modern materials, such as Wood family genealogies
		  and biographies, were added to the collection as well.
		  Major subjects of the collection include Trinity College
		  during the mid 1880s and Wood's career as a minister in
		  North Carolina and as a missionary in China during the
		  early 1860s. Materials range in date from 1852-1984 (bulk
		  1855-1892).

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Born 23 Oct. 1829, Randolph Co. N.C. Wood was a
		  clergyman in the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist
		  Episcopal Church, South. Educated at Normal College
		  (Randolph Co., N.C.), receiving his A.B. in 1855. He was a
		  missionary in Shanghai, China from 1860-1866, and served as
		  President of Trinity College (Randolph, Co., N.C.) in
		  1883-1884. Died in Gibson, N.C., 25 Nov. 1893. </p>
         
         <p> When Braxton Craven died in 1882, the Trustees
		  turned to Marquis Lafayette Wood (1829-1893). Although he
		  served as president only a year-and-a-half, his leadership
		  proved critical during the period following Craven's death.
		  A minister and Craven's close friend, Wood was a graduate
		  of the school--the only president who was an alumnus in
		  Duke's history. He worked diligently for the college, was
		  the first president to raise money for endowment, and
		  remained on the Board of Trustees the rest of his life,
		  even submitting the resolution in 1889 to move the college
		  from his beloved native Randolph County to Durham, N.C. His
		  one-sentence definition of the college presidency was that
		  "All great enterprises require time and patience and labor
		  and suffering and money." After Wood left in 1884, the
		  college was run for three years by a Committee of the Board
		  of Trustees. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Marquis Lafayette Wood form part of
		  the records of the President of Duke University. Wood's
		  papers span the years 1852-1984, with the bulk occurring
		  between 1855 and 1892. Included are diaries,
		  correspondence, minutes, account books, writings, sermons
		  and addresses, and other materials. The materials are
		  useful for the study of Trinity College during the mid
		  1880s. Minutes from the college trustee meetings held in
		  1883-1884, accounts, and correspondence form the official
		  records of Wood's presidency. Letters concerning the
		  federal support and enrollment of Cherokee Indians at
		  Trinity are of particular interest. Wood's diaries from
		  1883 and 1884 provide limited information on Trinity
		  College.</p>
         
         <p>Wood's ministerial career is the major subject
		  documented in the collection. The diaries span the years
		  1856-1885; sermons correspondence, and miscellaneous
		  volumes supplement the account of Wood's service that is
		  reflected in the diaries. Diary entries portray Wood's life
		  as an itinerant pastor, missionary, and presiding elder in
		  the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The papers portray
		  Wood's life as well as provide information on a number of
		  western North Carolina churches, including those in the
		  Salisbury District, Iredell District, Surry Circuit, the
		  Greensboro District, and the Charlotte District. </p>
         
         <p>Of particular significance are the diaries and
		  letters that date from 1860 to 1866, the years Wood served
		  in China. Beginning in 1859, the diaries relate Wood's
		  voyage to China, his observations on life and customs in
		  China, and his views of the Chinese. Ellen (Morphis),
		  Wood's wife, became ill while in China and died. Wood noted
		  both her symptoms and attempted treatments in his diary.
		  The diaries from the period also reflect Wood's
		  observations on the Tai-Ping Rebellion. Other papers
		  concerning Wood's service in China include synopses of
		  letters Wood wrote to E.W. Sehon of the Missionary Society
		  of the Episcopal Church, South.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to serving as minister, Wood was
		  interested in the history of North Carolina Methodism. Wood
		  collected and penned accounts of early western North
		  Carolina churches and ministers. His manuscripts on Sunday
		  School work in the Fayetteville District and the rise of
		  Methodism in the Yadkin Valley are among the extant notes,
		  letters, and volumes. </p>
         
         <p>Other figures and subjects reflected in the papers
		  include Charles Force Deems, Methodist minister, Wood
		  family genealogy, and Wood's lifelong loyalty to Trinity
		  College. An address by Wood to the Trinity College alumni
		  association is present. </p>
