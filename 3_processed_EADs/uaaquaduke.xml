         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>A LGBT student organization has been present on the Duke Campus since the founding of the Duke Gay Alliance in 1972, however it has seen many name changes over the years.  Past names include: Duke Gay and Lesbian Alliance; Duke Gay, Bisexual, and Lesbian Association (1994); and Gothic Queers (1997).  In 2002, the organization took the name Alliance of Queer Undergraduates at Duke (AQUADuke).</p>
         
         <p>AQUADuke is formally recognized by the Duke Student Government, and is Duke University's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning student organization. The group is non-exclusive and welcomes all those that are out and about, closeted and curious, or just open-minded.  Their mission and purpose is to provide a safe and supportive environment for students questioning their sexuality while spreading awareness of LGBTQ issues, providing support for LGBTQ members of our community, and dealing with issues facing the LGBTQ community on and off the Duke University campus.
</p>
         
         <p>In Spring 2008, AquaDuke merged with Duke Allies to form Blue Devils United.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection contains phone logbooks, flyers, agendas, newsletters, and financial records of the Gay Alliance, the Duke Gay and Lesbian Alliance, and the Duke Gay, Bisexual, and Lesbian Association.  Subjects present include AIDS, legal issues, civil rights, local and national resources concerning gay issues, and other matters.  The dates of the material range from 1973-1995.</p>
         
         <p>The phone logbooks (1990-1992) are accounts of phone messages received by the organization, but they also acted as an information clearinghouse for the busy AQUADuke members serving as a central location to leave messages for other members providing insight into the organization's activities, concerns, and internal issues.  </p>
