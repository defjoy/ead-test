         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Letters, diaries, and miscellaneous papers documenting the business enterprises and family life of a young Englishman who immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1842. Ten diaries (1850-1853) present a detailed account of hosiery manufacture as a family enterprise in which both men and women participated. Community events in Nicetown, Pa., were described as well. Diaries also document the relationship between Barrow and his alcoholic father who was sometimes physically abusive to family members. The author described his efforts to attain financial independence and to create a new life for himself and his wife. Letters from Ann Rusby, a teacher, and diary entries by Barrows, reveal much about their courtship, their sexual relationship and their secret marriage. Letters to and from family members in England depict the contrast in living and working conditions between the two countries. The collection includes an assortment of envelopes arranged by method of sealing.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
