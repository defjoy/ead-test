         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>ECOS (Environmentally Conscious Organization of
		  Students) was formed at Duke University in 1969. ECOS grew
		  to include members of the Durham, N.C. community in their
		  efforts to educate people on environmental concerns. Other
		  environmental groups active around the Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
		  area in the early 1970s were: Chapel Hill ECOS,
		  Organization for Environmental Quality (Raleigh), and the
		  Conservation Council of North Carolina. </p>
         
         <p> ECOS members were advocates of University-wide
		  recycling, conservative population growth, and responsible
		  consumption. At Duke University, members proposed an
		  environmental studies program and organized a teach-in.
		  ECOS came to be known for their recycling efforts,
		  employing a small staff to collect newspapers, aluminum,
		  and glass for resale to local companies. </p>
         
         <p> Some of ECOS' awareness-raising activities
		  included a Bike-a-Thon between Raleigh and Durham,
		  protesting the development of the Eno River area,
		  protesting construction of the New Hope Dam, and lobbying
		  for environmentally sound work spaces. The Eno River Park
		  project was particularly important to the Durham, N.C.
		  region. In the early 1970s, ECOS and supporters led a
		  campaign to save the Eno River area from commercial
		  development. Due to ECOS' protest efforts, the city of
		  Durham withdrew its efforts to construct a reservoir. The
		  Eno River State Park was established in 1972. </p>
         
         <p> As of 2003, ECOS is known as the Environmental
		  Alliance and is active at Duke University. </p>

		  Dam project, and Carolina Power and Light Company's
		  proposed power plant in Wake County. The records also
