         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Carl Mydans was an American photographer who spent most of his career with <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Life</title> magazine. Some of his most memorable photographs were taken during World War II. </p>
         
         <p>Born on May 20, 1907, Mydans studied journalism and photography in Boston in 1930 and spent some time as a writer in New York. He began working for the Farm Security Administration in 1935, where he documented rural and farm life, including migrant farm families, in the South and in New England. In 1936, he was hired as one of the first staff photographers for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Life</title> magazine. His early assignments included documenting cattle ranchers in Freer, Texas, and tunnel <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">sand hogs</title> in New York City. He married his wife, Shelley Smith, in 1938, and they became a writer-photographer team for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Life</title>. When World War II began, the Mydanses traveled throughout Europe and Asia. They were captured by the Japanese after the fall of the Philippines in 1941, and spent almost two years as prisoners-of-war in Manila and Shanghai. Following their release, Carl Mydans went back to the front in Europe and covered the liberation of Italy and France. His acquaintence with General Douglas MacArthur led to his covering MacArthur's return to the Philippines in 1944 and the eventual surrender of Japan in 1945.</p>
         
         <p>In 1947, the Mydanses became Time-Life's bureau chiefs in Tokyo, and they remained in the Pacific area for the next several years. Carl Mydans was present during a 1948 earthquake in Fukui, Japan, and also covered the Korean War in 1950 and 1951. He traveled the world through the 1960s and 1970s, and worked for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Life</title> until it ceased weekly publication in 1972. He continued to work as a photographer for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Time</title> and other publications until his eighties. He died on August 16, 2004.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Collection (2010-0023) consists of 66 black and white photographs spanning Carl Mydans' career. Images from his early work for the Farm Security Administration include photographs of cowboys and ranchers from Freer, Texas; migrant workers and rural life in Texas and Arkansas; a photograph of the Capitol building through a Washington, D.C. slum; and political banners from the 1936 presidential election. </p>
         
         <p>The majority of the collection dates from his time working for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Life</title> magazine as a war photographer. Mydans' subjects include the Sino-Japanese war beginning in 1941, his time in the Philippines and the battle for Manila, his coverage of the Allies in France and Italy during the liberation of Europe, and his travels with General Douglas MacArthur during MacArthur's return to the Philippines and the subsequent surrender of the Japanese. Mydans' World War II images are fairly evenly split into equal parts combat and street scenes: there seem to be just as many photographs of tea rooms and markets in China as there are photographs of Japanese bombing raids in the Philippines. This portion of the collection also includes some of Mydans' most famous and memorable photographs, including a portrait of General MacArthur with his sunglasses and pipe, a photograph of MacArthur leading the army ashore in the Philippines, and an image of a <emph render="doublequote">collaborater</emph> being shaved following the liberation of France.</p>
         
         <p>Another significant component of the collection is Mydans' post-World War II images, which include Japanese war crimes tribunals, Korean War coverage, portraits of coal miners and politicians in Europe, and photographs taken during the Fukui earthquake. Also included is a self-portrait of Mydans in Vietnam, the only photograph taken in color, from 1968.</p>
         
         <p>Nearly all of the photographs have handwritten captions on the back, which have been transcribed in the Collection Description portion of the finding aid. Some of the handwritten captions have been supplemented by a caption list, available in hard copy in Box 3. [Brackets] indicate information added by processors. Some prints have also been signed by Mydans.</p>
