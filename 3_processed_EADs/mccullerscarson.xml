         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Carson McCullers, born Lula Carson Smith, was an American author of novels, short stories, plays, and poetry. She was born in Columbus, Georgia, in 1917, and studied piano as a child. She left Georgia for New York City in 1934, where she began taking creative writing classes at Columbia University and New York University. Her first essay, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Wunderkind,</title> was published in 1936.</p>
         
         <p>McCullers returned to the South in 1937 and lived with her husband, Reeves, in Charlotte, North Carolina. <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</title>, a novel written in the Southern Gothic tradition, was published in 1940. Subsequent works included <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Reflections in a Golden Eye</title> (1941), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title> (1946), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Ballad of the Sad Cafe</title> (1951), and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Square Root of Wonderful</title> (1957). </p>
         
         <p>McCullers' personal life was tumultuous: she divorced Reeves McCullers in 1941, moving to New York and eventually to Paris after World War II, where she was friends with Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote. She remarried Reeves McCullers in 1945, and he committed suicide in 1953. Carson McCullers suffered from depression, alcoholism, and strokes throughout her life. She died in New York in 1967.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Carson McCullers Papers span the years 1941-1995 and are divided into six series: Correspondence, Writings, Jordan Massee Notebooks, Photographs, Printed Materials, and Clippings. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes numerous letters from Carson McCullers to Jordan Massee, Paul Bigelow, Edith Sitwell, and other friends and family members. Most significant in the series is the correspondence between McCullers and Tennessee Williams, in which both writers touch on a variety of topics such as the writing process, health, marital problems, and their travels. Carson's relationship with her husband, Reeves McCullers, is a frequent topic.</p>
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>, the largest in the collection, comprises typewritten manuscripts of several long as well as short published works of McCullers, including <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title> (which has handwritten revisions) and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Clock Without Hands</title>. Notable short writings include verses that McCullers wrote for children, an essay on literary criticism, and two short works that are inscribed and signed by the author. At the end of the series there are also two poems by Edith Sitwell. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Jordan Massee Notebooks Series</emph> contains a catalogue that Massee compiled about the McCullers papers he owned, as well as a notebook with notes about McCullers and extracts from his journals. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> consists of five photographs, most of which are of Carson McCullers. Particularly noteworthy is a photograph taken by Henri Cartier-Bresson, where McCullers appears with the editor of Harper's Bazaar, George Davis.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> both contain reviews of writings by McCullers and materials related to their dramatization. The latter series includes two short essays by Tennessee Williams as well as numerous obituaries published after McCullers's death.</p>

               <p>The largest component of the series is the typewritten manuscript of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title>, with the author's hand-written corrections. There are numerous variants for certain portions of the novel and material not used in the published version. The series also contains a copy of the manuscript of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Clock without Hands</title>, which was sent at the request of McCullers to Jordan Massee by Robert Lantz of Robin Productions. Other material includes Jordan Massee's notes about <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title>, as well as published and unpublished short pieces written by McCullers. Among these are an essay by McCullers entitled <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Russian Realists and Southern Writers</title>; her contemplation on the writing process; a collection of verses for children originally bound in a notebook, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sweet as a Pickle and Clean as a Pig</title>;  handwritten lyrics for a song from <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Ballad of the Sad Cafe</title>; and finally, typescripts of <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Dual Angel</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">A Tree.

               <p>Contains two notebooks compiled in 1974 by Jordan Massee, a cousin and close friend of Carson McCullers, as well as a brief recapitulation that was added three years later. The first notebook is a catalog of the Carson McCullers collection Massee owned; the second notebook consists of excerpts from Massee's journals, 1949-1965, and his household account book for 1956. This volume also contains an introduction by Massee written in 1974, a list of Carson's visits to his apartment in New York in 1957, notes concerning the funeral arrangements for Carson, and his recollections of a conversation with Truman Capote about Carson in July 1965.  </p>
