            <p>Brown included these items in a 36-page, string-bound patent "Memory Book of College Life," with Duke's seal on the cover.  The scrapbook focuses especially on Brown's life during 1924-1926 and on the general experiences of freshmen and sophomores at Trinity College.  Loose items were placed in sleeves and protective sheets between pages containing three dimensional items, for preservation. </p>
