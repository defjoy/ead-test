         <abstract>The
		  Commission on University Governance at Duke University was
		  created in April 1969 by Chancellor pro tem Barnes
		  Woodhall. The group was charged with studying changes in
		  university organization nationwide to create a model for
		  administration at Duke. The group also focused on
		  increasing student participation in university governance.
		  The records include minutes, memoranda, correspondence, and
		  reports produced by the Commission on University
		  Governance, as well as reports, clippings, and other
		  printed matter gathered by the Commission for reference
		  purposes. The Commission published its findings and
		  recommendations in three "Interim Reports," concerning the
		  Board of Trustees, the Central Administration, and
		  Departmental Governance.

            <p>Collection was 4.2 linear feet (7 Hollinger and
			 1 RS box) pre-processing. Primary actions taken include
			 refoldering, weeding of duplicate materials, and
			 establishing series arrangement. Forty 7" reel to reel
			 audiotape recordings of the Commission's meetings were
			 discarded, as typed transcriptions and/or detailed minutes
			 were available for each of its 34 meetings. Also discarded
			 was a 4-volume report to the British Parliament by the
			 Prime Minister's Committee on Higher Education (Robbins
			 Committee), as relevant portions were photocopied and
			 retained with other reference files. Eleven volumes of The
			 Study of Education at Stanford were discarded, while Volume
			 X, "Government of the University," was retained. Student
			 Perspective, 1964: The Student Philosophy and other Duke
			 reports found in multiple University Archives collections
			 were likewise discarded. A binder which included copies of
			 Commission minutes and correspondence through the first 10
			 meetings, created to introduce new Duke President Terry
			 Sanford to the Commission's purpose and actions, was
			 discarded, as it duplicated exactly the material in folders
			 for the first 10 meetings. However, the introduction to
			 this volume, which provides a summary of the Commission's
			 creation and Fall 1969 activities, is filed in Box 1 under
			 Correspondence - Miscellaneous. </p>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The late 1960s was a time of rapid change at
		  American colleges and universities, as most experienced a
		  surge of politicization by student activists; at Duke, this
		  was most clearly exemplified in the Allen Building takeover
		  of February 13, 1969. In response both to this local event
		  and to national trends in higher education, the Faculty
		  Committee on Student Concerns, the Executive Committee of
		  the Academic Council, and the
		  Student-Faculty-Administrative Council (SFAC) recommended
		  the creation of a Commission on University Governance. In
		  April 1969 Chancellor pro tem Barnes Woodhall appointed
		  this committee, with the hopes that future demonstrations
		  similar to the Allen Building takeover might be avoided if
		  effective official opportunities for student participation
		  in university governance could be established. The
		  Commission on University Governance was therefore charged
		  with the task of studying changes in university
		  organization nationwide, focusing particularly on student
		  participation in governance, and making recommendations for
		  Duke accordingly. </p>
         
         <p> Members of the Commission eventually agreed that
		  this purpose was best accomplished by dividing university
		  governance into three categories: departmental governance,
		  the central university administration, and the Board of
		  Trustees. The latter body was already the subject of a
		  study by a Board of Trustees Special Committee headed by
		  Brantley Watson, and the Commission coordinated its efforts
		  with the Watson Committee. The Commission on University
		  Governance also worked simultaneously and cooperatively
		  with the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, "The Committee of
		  Twelve," which replaced the SFAC as the forum for airing
		  Duke community grievances and which was meant to advise the
		  administration concerning potentially volatile campus
		  issues. The Commission on University Governance met 34
		  times between October 27, 1969 and May 17, 1970, at which
		  time it adjourned for the school year and was never
		  reactivated.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         
         <p>The records of the Commission on University
		  Governance span the years 1969 to 1971, with most of the
		  material dating from 1969-1970 academic year. The
		  collection is organized into two series: materials created
		  by the Commission, and materials collected by the
		  Commission.</p>
         
         <p>The records generated by the Commission on
		  University Governance consist primarily of minutes and
		  transcripts of its official meetings, including
		  supplementary materials distributed for discussion at these
		  meetings. Typed transcript drafts exist for meetings 1
		  through 19, and this series contains minutes for all 34
		  meetings. Also included in this series are two copies of
		  each of the Commission's three Interim Reports (Board of
		  Trustees, Central Administration, and Departmental
		  Governance), as well as drafts of these reports. Other
		  official Commission records include information on the
		  Commission's members and clippings from the
		  <emph render="italic">Chronicle</emph>,
		  <emph render="italic">Durham Morning Herald</emph>, and
		  <emph render="italic">Durham Sun</emph> dated September 30,
		  1969 to April 16, 1970 concerning the work of the
		  Commission. Correspondence not included with Commission
		  minutes is divided into two folders: 1) letters dated April
		  to September 1969, all regarding the establishment of the
		  Commission, and 2) official correspondence dated after that
		  time, including a January 1970 introduction to the
		  Commission's activities for new Duke President Terry
		  Sanford and a January 1971 response to the Commission's
		  Interim Reports from the Provost.</p>
         
         <p>The Commission on University Governance amassed a
		  significant collection of reference materials for use in
		  formulating its reports, which are roughly arranged into
		  subseries. It appears that members of the Commission twice
		  attempted to catalog and collate these materials, as two
		  indexes entitled "Materials on Hand" and "Table of
		  Contents" are a part of this series. However, neither index
		  is accompanied by a complete set of the materials listed on
		  it. To preserve original order, the sections of listed
		  materials that are present have been identified and
		  retained, even when they duplicate each other. Printed
		  matter that was not a part of either of these subseries
		  falls into two categories: reports and other matter from
		  Duke committees, schools, and organizations, and printed
		  matter that was created by other universities and
		  organizations. This series also contains several
		  bibliographies, arranged both by subject and by format, as
		  well as periodical abstracts, alphabetized by author,
		  donated to the Commission from the Special Committee on
		  Student Residential Life. Also present in this series are
		  the complete minutes of the Chancellor's Advisory
		  Committee, known as the Committee of Twelve, which met
		  nineteen times between October 1969 and March 1970, when it
		  was disbanded. </p>
         
         <p>University Archives also has catalogued copies of
		  the Commission's three Interim Reports: <lb/>Board of
		  Trustees - 378.756 D877CTR <lb/>Central Administration -
