         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The North Carolina Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi began in 1934 and was the fifty-third Phi Kappa Psi chapter in the nation.</p>
         
         <p>
During the late 1960s, the Chapter was disbanded due to students serving in Vietnam.  The fraternity had 66 members in spring 1968 but had dropped to six members by fall 1969. The numbers eventually rose; there were 22 members in spring 1970. </p>
         
         <p>
The Chapter participated in Greek Week, various social outings with Little Sisters, and general philanthropy projects. One famous prank pulled by the fraternity involved members decorating a dormitory tower clock in Mickey Mouse attire (1979).  The chapter was well-known for its annual James Valvano Memorial Celebrity Auction, which benefited the children's cancer research program at Duke Children's Hospital. In 2001, Phi Kappa Psi's housing privileges were revoked.  The fraternity has not been chartered at Duke University since that time.
