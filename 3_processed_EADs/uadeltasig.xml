         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>From http://deltasig.org/about/index.html</p>
         
         <p>Late in 1899, a handful of undergraduate men began meeting between classes at City College of New York in Manhattan, N.Y. Some of the men had known one another before they graduated from the New York public school system, and they had wanted to continue their friendships at City College. The obvious solution was to join a fraternity, but this group of friends was an affiliation of Jews and Christians. At the time, entry to all-Jewish and all-Christian fraternities was barred to individuals and groups that mixed religions. Based on the principle of universal brotherhood, the men founded Delta Sigma Phi on December 10, 1899.</p>
         
         <p>Delta Sigma Phi was incorporated in New York City on December 2, 1902. The incorporation papers stated objectives of disseminating "principles of friendship and brotherhood among college men, without respect to race or creed." The purpose of the fraternity was "to fulfill the desire of serious young college men for a fellowship and brotherhood, as near a practical working ideal as possible not fettered with too many traditional prejudices and artificial standards of membership, and accompanied by a clean, pure, and honorable chapter home life." The fraternity is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>
         
         <p>The Alpha Epsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Phi was chartered at Duke University in 1920. Early meetings (1920-1921) held discussions of fraternity jewelry, pledging, installing officers, recruiting new members from prep schools, purchasing furniture and draperies, and planning initiations. In 1920, the chapter adopted Zeta Tau Alpha as their sister fraternity. As of 2006, the members of the Alpha Epsilon live on-campus at Kilgo Quad and are governed by the Interfraternity Council at Duke University. The Alpha Epsilon chapter is currently active.
