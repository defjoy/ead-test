         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection includes News Service scrapbooks for both Trinity College and Duke University. General interest and sports news make up the bulk of the clippings. Among the major subjects are student life and traditions, the building of the university, and news of the major and minor sports. Some of the clippings relate to obscure organizations at Duke, including the Cat's Head Club.  In addition to clippings are news releases, programs and correspondence. Scrapbooks 8-21 contain clippings only.  According to a handwritten note on the clippings envelope in box 11, scrapbook 22 was dismantled in 1989.  The clippings envelope contains articles related to the last illness, death and burial of President Few.  The collection ranges in date from 1916-1944.</p>

            <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
            
            <p>Some of the scrapbooks were unhinged in the box.  The pages were foldered, keeping the original order.  Many pages and clippings are brittle and should be handled with care. </p>
