         <p>Harold T. Parker taught history at Duke University; he specialized in modern European history, European intellectual history and 19th century Europe.   Parker was born near Cincinnati, Ohio on December 26, 1907.  He received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from University of Chicago in 1928 and 1934 respectively.  He began teaching at Duke University in 1939 and retired in 1977, although he continued to teach after his retirement as a professor emeritus.  His career at Duke was interrupted during World War II, when he served in the Pacific Theater.  Parker was known for his teaching excellence according to one of his obituaries, and was awarded the Annual Distinguished Teaching Award by the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the United Methodist church in 1973.  In addition to being a professor, Parker published several books including <emph render="italic">The Cult of Antiquity and the French Revolutionaries</emph> (1937) and <emph render="italic">Three Napoleonic Battles</emph> (1944).  He was also a longstanding member of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Durham, NC and published a history of the church in 1996.  Harold T. Parker passed away in 2002.  </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
