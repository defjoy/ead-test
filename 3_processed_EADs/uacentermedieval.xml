         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p> The Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies
		  was established at Duke University around 1968 after a
		  committee on Medieval and Renaissance Studies formed around
		  1966 to examine the possibilities of combining courses from
		  a variety of disciplines. The committee analyzed faculty
		  resources at Duke University and critiqued programs at
		  other institutions. The committee then made recommendations
		  to establish a Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies,
		  create a journal, provide undergraduate and graduate study
		  programs, and establish a monograph series to permit
		  publication of studies relating to the Renaissance and
		  Middle Ages. Additionally, they recommended reviving the
		  Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies,
		  active at Duke University from 1963 to 1969. </p>
         
         <p> Each proposal was approved, and interdisciplinary
		  coursework was planned for the 1968-1969 academic year
		  under the guidance of the Medieval and Renaissance Studies
		  Committee and the Duke Humanities Council. The
		  distinguishing feature of the Program in Medieval and
		  Renaissance Studies was the requirement of intensive work
		  in the transmission of medieval texts. Degree-granting
		  programs combined courses in fine arts, languages, history,
		  and philosophy to achieve the goals of a well-rounded
		  education in the humanities. The Center also sponsored or
		  supported conferences, symposia, lecture series, meetings,
		  and cooperative workshops with the University of North
		  Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since 1971, the Center has
		  produced the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Medieval and Early
		  Modern Studies</title> (formerly titled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Medieval and
		  Renaissance Studies</title>). </p>
         
         <p>As of 2003, the Center for Medieval and
		  Renaissance Studies has over forty faculty in ten different
		  departments. All faculty participate in the University
		  Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, which is the
		  academic unit of the Center. The Center currently
		  collaborates with the University of North Carolina at
		  Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in the
		  Joint Program for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. </p>
