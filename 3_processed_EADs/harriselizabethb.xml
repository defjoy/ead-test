         <abstract>Elisabeth Baldwin Wiley Harris was a resident of a large plantation near Sparta, Hancock County, Georgia. The bulk of the collection consists of six volumes and fragments of a manuscript diary with daily entries from 1862 to 1893, written by Elizabeth Harris.  Although there is a fragment of the diary dated 1858, the daily entries begin Jan. 4, 1862, and continue, with brief interruptions for illnesses and family crises, until Oct. 26, 1893.  Harris occasionally mentions local and national politics, events connected with the Civil War, and slavery, but most of the entries concern the weather, family matters, births, deaths, illnesses, the state of her soul, and daily activities.  The collection also contains one letter dated 1860, two letters dated 1957 and 1958, and a genealogy from the donor which gives background information about the author and her family.</abstract>

         <p>Elizabeth Baldwin Wiley Harris was born in Hancock County, Georgia, August 24, 1821, the daughter of Eliza DeWitt and William Wiley, a well-to-do planter.  She was one of four children.  The family later migrated to New York.  In 1845 Elizabeth married James Martin Harris, also of Hancock County, who owned a plantation there of 10,000 acres. Eliza was a descendent of the DeWitt family, which came from Rochelle, France, and founded New Rochelle, N.Y. Avis and Cornelia were sisters of Eliza.  Elizabeth B. (Wiley) and James M. Harris had no children, but they adopted Moses Wiley, a son of her brother Samuel Wiley and Sarah (Carnes) Wiley.  Moses Wiley Harris was the father of the donor, Mrs. Elizabeth B.H. Holmes.  Fate, the overseer of the Harris plantation, was the son of an African prince.
