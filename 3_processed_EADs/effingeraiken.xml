         <abstract>The wholesale firm of Effinger &amp; Aiken, located in Baltimore, Maryland, supplied consumer goods to stores in cities and rural towns from Maryland to Florida during the early 1900s. The collection includes eight business account books of Effinger &amp; Aiken together with roughly 350 related business correspondence and papers. The account books document the firm's sale and shipping of goods such as crockery, glassware, wooden items, hardware, tools, and building materials throughout the southern Atlantic states. Each of two leather-bound ledgers begins with an alphabetical index listing the customer and internal accounts recorded within the ledger and their corresponding page numbers. The related business correspondence and papers, which chiefly document the firm's difficulties with debt collection, are loosely inserted in these ledgers near the associated customer accounts. Four cloth-bound daybooks record customer names with itemized purchase and/or payment transactions each day. The daybook with entries from 1895 to 1896 most likely does not pertain to the transactions of Effinger &amp; Aiken. One small, cloth-bound account book records, in tabular form, amounts "Collect," "Cash," "Credit," and "Wholesale" for each day of the month from June 1905 to July 1920; and another small, cloth-bound account book records daily collections from 1906 to 1907.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The wholesale firm of Effinger &amp; Aiken (partners Charles H. Effinger and George B. Aiken), located in Baltimore, Maryland, supplied consumer goods to hundreds of hardware, grocery, drug, and general goods stores in cities and rural towns in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the early 1900s. Several traveling salesmen represented the firm; and goods such as cutlery, crockery, glassware, wooden items, hardware, tools, rope, saddles, guns and ammunition, fishing and hunting equipment, wagon wheels and axels, farm equipment, and building materials generally were shipped by railroad freight.</p>
         
         <p>The firm's beginning and ending dates of operation are unclear. However, the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">R.L. Polk &amp; Co's Baltimore City Directory for 1899</title> lists Effinger as a partner in Ramsey &amp; Effinger, a firm specializing in china, glassware, and house furnishing goods; and the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Federal Reporter, Volume 184</title> indicates that on February 9, 1909, the partnership of Effinger &amp; Aiken and each partner individually were adjudicated bankrupts.</p>
