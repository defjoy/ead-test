         <abstract>On February 13, 1969, Duke University students in the Afro-American Society occupied the the main administration building to bring attention to the needs of black students. These needs included an African American studies department, a black student union, and increased enrollment and financial support for black students. This and subsequent events became known as the Allen Building Takeover. The Allen Building Takeover Collection contains announcements, flyers, publications, correspondence, handouts, reports, transcripts, ephemera, clippings, a bibliography, WDBS radio broadcasts, oral histories, and photographs documenting Black Culture Week (Feb. 4-12, 1969), the Allen Building Takeover (Feb. 13, 1969), student demands, statements by Provost Marcus Hobbs and by Duke President Douglas Knight, student convocations and demonstrations both in support of and against the Takeover, and later events on the Duke campus and in Durham, N.C. In addition, the collection contains clippings and artwork related to remembering the Takeover, including the 2002 Allen Building lock-in. Major subjects include African American students and civil rights demonstrations.

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>On the morning of February 13, 1969, between 50 and 75 black students entered the Allen Building and proceeded to barricade and occupy it. They renamed the building the Malcolm X Liberation School. The students issued a list of demands to the administration, [which included an accredited African-American Studies Department, a black dorm, a black student union, an increase in enrollment and financial support for black students, protection from police harassment, and better working conditions for non-academic staff of the University]. Provost Marcus Hobbs read a statement to the students at about 3:30 PM, urging them to leave the building within one hour to begin a peaceful discussion of the issues. Sometime after 5 o'clock, after a warning from Provost Hobbs that they would face legal ramifications for staying, the students decided to exit. Although the exit was peaceful, a large crowd of mostly white students had gathered outside the building during the day, and this crowd and the police became entangled. The police fired tear gas on the students. </p>
         
         <p>Immediately following the police action, students met to discuss how to proceed. Many students and faculty were upset by the administration's support of the police action; other students and faculty felt that the takeover of the Allen Building was lawless and disruptive. Those who supported the Takeover called for a three day strike on campus and offered alternative classes. Students opposed to the Takeover urged fellow students to attend classes as normal. The administration attempted to calm the campus and address some of the demands posed by the Takeover participants. President Knight addressed Duke on the campus radio station, WDBS. </p>
         
         <p>Afro-American Society and administration members met several times to begin forming an African-American Studies program. The two parties could not reach an agreement on what type of committee should oversee the program. On March 10, a group of students marched to downtown Durham along with students from other colleges to protest the situation. The next day, March 11, 1969, students again went to downtown Durham and marched with other students and Durham residents. The march turned violent, with store windows smashed and other damage to property. The mayor put a curfew on the city for several days. </p>
         
         <p>Dozens of Duke's black students threatened to leave campus following the lack of agreement on the African-American Studies program. They instead planned to attend the Malcolm X Liberation University, a newly-developed school led by community activist Howard Fuller. However, the students soon reversed their decision and decided to remain at Duke University. On March 19, a University Hearing Committee found the students who had occupied the building guilty of violating university regulations. All defendants were sentenced to one year of probation. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection features a variety of materials documenting the Allen Building Takeover at Duke University. The first series,<ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Subject files</ref>, includes announcements, flyers, publications, correspondence, handouts, reports, transcripts, and ephemera relating to Black Culture Week (Feb. 4-12, 1969), the Allen Building Takeover (Feb. 13, 1969) and student demands, statements by Provost Marcus Hobbs and by Duke President Douglas Knight, student convocations and demonstrations both in support of and against the Takeover, and later events on the Duke campus and in Durham, N.C. Also included are clippings of newspaper and magazine coverage of the Takeover from the campus paper<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Chronicle</title>, as well	as local, state, and national media.</p>
         
         <p>In addition, the collection contains clippings and artwork related to anniversaries and remembrance of the Takeover. Students created artwork in this collection while participating in the 2002 Allen Building lock-in, an event commemorating 1960s activism at Duke and an opportunity for students and administrators to discuss the racial climate on campus. </p>
         
         <p>Three<ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Related collections</ref>described with the Allen Building Takeover Collection consist of sound recordings and photographs. The first collection, WDBS Records, contains recordings of broadcast reports which aired on the campus radio station. These reports (Feb. 13-16, 1969) covered the Takeover, President Knight's response, and subsequent meetings, rallies, demonstrations, and speakers. The next related collection, Allen Building Takeover Oral History Collection, features oral history interviews conducted by Don Yannella for his 1985 senior honors thesis,<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Race Relations at Duke University and the Allen Building Takeover</title>. The	oral histories offer first-hand accounts of and reactions	to the Takeover from Duke students, staff, administrators,	and members of the Durham community. Finally, the	Photograph Collection includes ten black and white	photographs taken during and after the Takeover. Several	other collections also contain information on the Allen	Building Takeover.

               <p>Two collections of sound recordings, the WDBS broadcast recordings and the Allen Building Takeover Oral History Collection, are directly related to the 1969 Allen	Building Takeover. Both offer first-hand accounts of the	events surrounding the Takeover and varied perspectives on	these demonstrations within the Duke community. In	addition, the University Archives Photograph Collection	includes ten black and white photographs taken during and	after the Takeover.</p>
               
               <p>Several other collections also contain	information on the Allen Building Takeover. For a complete	subject guide and bibliography of resources, please see the<ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Subject files</ref>series.</p>

                  <p>WDBS was founded at Duke University in 1950 as a student-run AM station sponsored by the student government. The station received an FM license in 1971. Due to financial difficulties, WDBS ended in 1983.</p>
                  
                  <p>This group of broadcast recordings features reports about the Allen Building Takeover and subsequent events. While the cassette reference copies of these broadcasts are stored with the Allen Building Takeover Collection, the original reel to reel tapes of the broadcasts remain in the WDBS records.</p>
