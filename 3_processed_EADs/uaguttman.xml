         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Norman Guttman was born October 17, 1920 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  He married Renate Pawel on February 6, 1948.  He received his B. A. degree in 1942 from the University of Minnesota and his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1951.  He came to Duke soon after earning his Ph.D. and began teaching in the Dept. of Psychology.   Dr. Guttman was Director of Graduate Studies in Psychology from 1963-1964 and 1965-1967.  He was also active in curricular reform at Duke.  His chief interests were learning stimulus generalization, conditioning, motivation, and the history of psychology. He died in April 1984.</p>
