         <abstract>The Science, Technology and Human Values program (STHV), formerly known as the Science, Society, and Human Values Program, was begun in 1979 by James F. Gifford and Seymour Mauskopf as a unique interdisciplinary program focused on developing a comprehensive view of science, medicine, and technology in social, historical, and ethical terms. The collection contains director's files from 1979-1984 which include administrative and student correspondence, memoranda, student term papers, course syllabi and evaluations, and five cassette tapes of sessions at a STHV symposium on space travel. The collection also contains brochures for the Round Table on Science and Public Affairs, dated 1976-1983.</abstract>

         <p>The Science, Technology and Human Values program (STHV), formerly known as the Science, Society, and Human Values Program, was begun in 1979 by James F. Gifford and Seymour Mauskopf as a unique interdisciplinary program focused on developing a comprehensive view of science, medicine, and technology in social, historical, and ethical terms. This program, likely influenced by the annual Round Table on Science and Public Affairs held at Duke of which Mauskopf served on the Advisory Committee, sought to educate undergraduate students through a variety of courses in multiple disciplines which culminated in the year-long senior seminar. The program offered monthly dinners, seminars, and panel discussions often with visiting professors on current and emerging issues in science within a societal context. Topics included the expansion of computer use, the role of modern medicine, genetics in humanistic perspective, and worldwide health policies among other things. The program was terminated in 2003. </p>
