         <p>As far as is known the first Duke students to study abroad were a small "foreign study group" who visited and took classes at the University of Dijon, France in 1927.  Formal investigation into a study abroad program began in 1947 when Dean Alice Baldwin appointed a committee to study the status of existing opportunities for Duke students to study elsewhere and for foreign students to study at Duke.  President Robert Flowers later made this committee a continuing university level committee.   </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
