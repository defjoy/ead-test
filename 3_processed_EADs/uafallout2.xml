         <p>The Fallout Preparedness Committeee was appointed by President Deryl Hart in September of 1961 to prepare Duke University for a possible nuclear attack. The forerunner to this committeee was commissioned on July 11, 1961 by Dean Barnes Woodhall to study the problem of fallout protection for the Duke Medical Center. President Hart expanded the responsibilities of the committeee to encompass the entire University Community. This committeee met regularly for two years and thoroughly studied and made provisions for the possibility of nuclear attack and two week confinement in the wake of nuclear radiation. The committeee conducted numerous investigations into the problems of shelter, water, food, ventilation, and medical care in the case of a nuclear attack and held extensive training seminars to prepare the entire campus for fallout procedures.</p>
