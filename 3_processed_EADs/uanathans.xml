         <abstract>The papers in this collection were brought together by Professor Sydney Nathans in conjunction with the controversy that arose in 1981 when Duke faculty members, along with alumni and alumnae, learned of president Terry Sanford's negotiations with former U. S. President Richard Nixon to locate the Nixon presidential library on the campus of Duke University.  The papers contain correspondence including that of Terry Sanford, and of the creator of the collection, Sydney Nathans; newspaper and magazine clippings as well as scholarly articles; text from speeches; official statements from groups opposing the Nixon Library, including the Committee Against the Nixon-Duke Library; and Sydney Nathans' handwritten notes from a variety of meetings. Documents also include Nathans' research on existing presidential libraries, the results of which were presented to the Duke Academic Council and to the Board of Trustees.</abstract>

         <bioghist>
            
            <p>In July 1981, Terry Sanford initiated negotiations with former U. S. President Richard Nixon (Duke Law '37) to locate the Nixon presidential library on the campus of Duke University, Nixon's alma mater. When this information was revealed to faculty members during the week of August 10, 1981, many opposed the proposition, citing Sanford's failure to consult the faculty prior to initiating negotiations.</p>
            
            <p>Many who opposed the library had moral objections to memorializing a President whose behavior in office was reproachable, and they feared a negative effect on the university's reputation. Other concerns included the effects of increased tourist traffic on campus and the uncertain aesthetic nature of the proposed structure. However, supporters of the Nixon Library argued that the scholarly and academic benefits of locating the Nixon Presidential Materials collection on campus should and would outweigh other concerns. These supporters tended to denounce the actions of vocal dissenters as divisive and arrogant. To learn more about these and other issues concerning the potential impact on Duke of the proposed Nixon Library, Professor Sydney Nathans researched modern presidential libraries. His findings were presented to members of the Duke Academic Council as well as the Board of Trustees, and he based his own formal statement in August of 1981 to the Council on these findings.</p>
            
            <p>Meetings of the Academic Council and Board of Trustees during September and October 1981 were dominated by the Nixon Library debate, and a group of faculty formed the Committee Against the Nixon-Duke Library (CANDL) to organize the efforts of faculty, students, alumni, and others opposed to the proposed library. Although the Academic Council voted not to pursue further negotiations with former president Nixon in a 35-34 decision at a September 3, 1981 meeting, the Board of Trustees later voted 9-2 to proceed. By April 1982, negotiations had stalled. One year later, Nixon's representatives announced that a site at Chapman College in San Clemente, California, had been chosen for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library.
