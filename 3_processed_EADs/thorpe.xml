         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Earl E. Thorpe - historian, clergyman, and activist - span the years 1942-1990, the bulk of the materials having been generated during the years 1965-1982. The collection consists of six series: <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr">Correspondence</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="writ">Writings and Speeches</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="pict">Pictures</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="prin">Printed Material</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="clip">Clippings</ref>, and <ref xlink:type="simple" target="gene">Genealogical Papers</ref>. Primarily, materials in the collection address Thorpe's work at North Carolina Central University (formerly North Carolina College), and his stints as a visiting professor at Harvard and Duke universities. Thorpe's service as chair of the program committee for the 1979 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH), and his term as president of the ASALH in 1980 are also well represented. Personal correspondence with family and students, and material reflective of Thorpe's life in the ministry are scattered throughout.</p>
         
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of the personal and professional correspondence of Thorpe. To 1970, material in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr">Correspondence Series</ref> centers on departmental politics at North Carolina College - specifically confusion and dissension over Thorpe's promotion to the chair of the history department. Letters from Thorpe's daughter at Spellman College in Atlanta, missives from friends and former students, a World War II era note from Thorpe to Martha V. Branch - Thorpe's future wife - and a small amount of professional correspondence are also represented.</p>
         
         <p>Beginning in 1971, correspondence turns to Thorpe's appointment as a visiting professor of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University. The letters reveal the substance of Thorpe's classes, and the intellectual environment at Harvard - especially as it concerns the Afro-American studies department. The challenges fading the organization and the development of a viable Afro-American Studies program emerge in correspondence between Thorpe and Ewart Gunier - chair of the Harvard black studies program - letters copied to Thorpe from others, and internal memoranda from Harvard's Afro-American Studies program.</p>
         
         <p>From 1972 through 1978, correspondence focuses again on Thorpe's duties at North Carolina Central University: tenure proceedings, student activism, class organization, personnel searches, and race politics on campus. Of particular interest are letters concerning the appointment of a white instructor to teach NCCU's Afro-American history survey, and the organization of the Helen G. Edmonds history colloquium. Matters unrelated to the history department or the workings of the campus are touched upon - planning for family reunions, and correspondence concerning Thorpe's health, for example.</p>
         
         <p>Beginning in 1978, correspondence turns to Thorpe's duties as chair of the program committee for the 1979 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH). In some detail, the letters recount the organization of the ASALH conference program - especially the politics and compromise involved in such a labor. Principal correspondents are ASALH officials, but included are notes from prominent African American historians. Panel and papers abstracts submitted for the committee's consideration are filed in the series marked <ref xlink:type="simple" target="writ">Writings and Speeches</ref>. A number of letters and abstracts represent efforts by the Association of Black Women Historians to organize panels at the meeting.</p>
         
         <p>In 1980, correspondence shifts to matters concerning Professor Thorpe's tenure as president of the ASALH. The organization of the 1981 conference in New Orleans is prominent. Correspondence pondering the future of the ASALH in light of recent mismanagement is also present. Of material not related to ASALH in this period, correspondence between Thorpe and Lerone Bennet, Jr. is especially interesting. In 1981, Thorpe charges Bennet with plagiarizing Thorpe's work in preparing a piece for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Ebony</title> magazine. As if preparing for a trial, Professor Thorpe goes so far as to collect evidence and build a case. The matter, however, is never fully resolved.</p>
         
         <p>Paul Zwillenberg has written a history honors thesis probing Professor Thorpe's thoughts and writings. <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">I Dream a World: An Intellectual Biography of Earl Endris Thorpe</title> may be examined in the reading room of the Duke University Archives.</p>
