         <p>Robert Kendall has been creating interactive multimedia poetry since 1990, making him one of the earliest practitioners of the form. He is the author of a book-length hypertext poem, A Life Set for Two (Eastgate Systems, 1996). His hypertext poetry has also appeared on disk in The Little Magazine and Version Box and is forthcoming in the anthology Behind the Lines (Eastgate). It has appeared on the Web at Iowa Review Web, BBC  Online, Eastgate Hypertext Reading Room, Cauldron &amp; Net, and Cortland Review. A Wandering City (Cleveland State University Poetry Center, 1992), his printed book of poems, won the CSU Poetry Center Prize. Kendall's printed poetry has appeared widely in magazines (including Rattapallax, Contact II, River Styx, New York Quarterly, Barrow Street, and Indiana Review), and several anthologies have included his work. He has received a New Jersey State Council on the Arts Fellowship for Literature and a New Forms Regional Grant Program Award.</p>

                     <p>Drafts for the following electronic poems. The drafts for Faith reveal the working process for creating the "layered" structure of verses unique to this poem: exploring alternatives for early layers by circling different combinations of words in the final layer. The drafts for After Closing utilize pages of paper cut into strips and stapled together in the manner of Queneau's "Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes."</p>
