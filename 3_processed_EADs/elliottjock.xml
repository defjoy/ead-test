         <p>John "Jock" Elliott grew up in New York City, and attended the Browning School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and eventually Harvard College. In 1942, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, and spent most of World War II as a major on the battleship Pennsylvania. After being discharged in 1945, he began working for the Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn (BBDO) advertising agency as a copywriter. He soon switched to management and within a few years, he became the company's youngest director. During his 15 year tenure with BBDO, he also served as account man for the Republican Party's Eisenhower-Nixon team.</p>
         
         <p>Elliott joined Ogilvy &amp; Mather (O&amp;M) in 1960 as Senior Vice President-Director and was soon placed in charge of acquiring the Shell Oil account, O&amp;M's largest account at the time. In 1965, David Ogilvy appointed Elliott the chairman of O&amp;M U.S., and in 1975 as chairman of O&amp;M International. Under Elliott's leadership, O&amp;M's domestic billings increased from $84 million to $252 million, and international billings from $659 million to $2.03 billion. He was responsible for acquiring such clients as IBM and American Express, and for attempting to acquire the J. Walter Thompson agency in 1979, a plan that did not materialize. In 1983 he was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame.</p>
         
         <p>Elliott also served as Chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA); Chairman of the American Advertising Federation's Hall of Fame Committee; Director of the New York City Park Association; Vice President and Trustee of the Museum of the City of New York; Trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and of the Browning School; and Life Trustee of Channel Thirteen. He also served on President Reagan's Advisory Board on Private Sector Initiatives, and was a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club, the Piping Rock Club and New York's Harvard Club. Outside of advertising, Elliott was known for his sizeable collection of Christmas books, which included more than 3,000 first editions, and which resulted in publication of two volumes: <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Ha! Christmas, An Exhibition of Jock Elliott's Christmas Books</title> (1999) and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Inventing Christmas, How Our Holiday Came to Be</title> (2001). He died in 2005.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Jock Elliott Papers cover the years 1945-2005, with the bulk of materials dating from 1961-1982, the period during which Elliott served as an executive with Ogilvy &amp; Mather (O&amp;M) advertising agency. The collection primarily consists of correspondence,  corporate annual reports, programs, speeches and photographs related to company meetings and events. The collection also includes videocassettes and memorabilia commemorating meetings and special events; materials relating to Eleanor Elliott and David Ogilvy; information on affirmative action hiring programs; as well as some speeches and correspondence from the period 1945-1959 when Elliott worked for the Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn (BBDO) advertising agency.

         <p>Note for clarification: Ogilvy &amp; Mather (O&amp;M) was co-founded by David Ogilvy in 1948. Originally called Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson, and Mather (OBM), in 1953 the company name was shortened to Ogilvy &amp; Mather (O&amp;M). Both entities are present in this collection.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

Folder titled <emph render="doublequote">Miscellaneous</emph> was derived from materials gathered from unfoldered, loose correspondence, and placed in two folders of miscellaneous stock-related correspondence.</p>

               <p>Consists primarily of typewritten speeches written by Jock Elliott for presentation at meetings of O&amp;M; the AAAA; as well as at invited talks at other organizations, clubs, colleges and universities. Includes some speeches written during Elliott's employment at BBDO between 1945 and 1956. Also included are hand- and typewritten drafts and published copies of Elliott's articles written for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> and the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">New York Times Magazine</title>, of Elliott's two books on Christmas, as well as miscellaneous short writings and poems. Includes Elliott's eulogy for David Ogilvy written for the edited volume <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Farewell: The Greatest Eulogies of Our Time.</title> The majority of speeches arrived in chronological order, with some appearing interspersed among loose files of other series. Speeches from correspondence, meeting and printed matter series were removed and placed in this series, in chronological order. Elliott's other writings arrived unfoldered and in no apparent order. Where possible, they were foldered and arranged alphabetically by title.</p>
