         <p>from UWP's homepage http://uwp.duke.edu/about/index.html</p>
         
         <p>The University Writing Program (UWP) promotes the role of writing in the undergraduate curriculum at Duke. They do so in three main ways:</p>
         
         <p>Writing 20: Academic Writing: All entering undergraduates must complete Writing 20 in their first year at Duke. Writing 20 offers an intensive introduction to the practice of Academic Writing. Each section of Writing 20 has a distinctive theme chosen by its instructor.</p>
         
         <p>Writing in the Disciplines (WID): All students in Trinity College must also take two writing-designated courses in the disciplines. These courses build upon the skills developed in Writing 20 in order to offer students a more specific sense of how to write in particular fields of study.
</p>
         
         <p>The Writing Studio offers free, one-on-one tutoring to students working on writing for any course they are taking at Duke.</p>
