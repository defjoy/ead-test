         <abstract>The
		  Bassett Affair is a celebrated case that helped establish
		  the concept of academic freedom in higher education in the
		  United States and is a benchmark incident in race relations
		  in the South. John Spencer Bassett, a Trinity College
		  professor, published a series of articles in the
		   South Atlantic
			 Quarterly (1903) that praised the accomplishments
		  of African Americans and offered views on how to improve
		  race relations. A campaign to remove Bassett from the
		  faculty was thwarted by a vote of support for Bassett from
		  the University's Board of Trustees on Dec. 2, 1903. The
		  collection contains essays, articles, clippings,
		  correspondence, reminiscences, and other published and
		  unpublished matter including Bassett's article,
		  Stirring Up the Fires of
			 Race Antipathy (1903); a scrapbook, 1903-1904, kept
		  by Trinity College officials with newspaper clippings
		  documenting national coverage the case received; copies of
		  letters by Theodore Roosevelt to Owen Wister (1906)
		  commenting on the case and on Trinity; manuscripts of
		  My Recollections of the
			 Bassett Trial, by Robert Lee Durham (1936),
		  The Bassett Affair: A Play
			 in Six Acts, by Baird Straughan (1975), and
		  Crisis at Trinity a
		  play by John Merritt (1989); lists of related materials in
		  other collections; various shorter articles and speeches
		  including comments by Richard L. Watson and an address to
		  the Academic Council by Terry Sanford; and materials from
		  the centennial celebration of the Bassett Affair, collected
		  by University Archives staff.
