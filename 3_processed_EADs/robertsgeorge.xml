         <p>At Old Umtali, George Arthur Roberts took charge
		  of agricultural training for the recently-established
		  mission. There he taught various subjects at mission
		  schools and conducted projects and experiments, including
		  instituting animal husbandry and introducing a variety of
		  food crops, as well as serving as blacksmith and resident
		  tooth-puller.</p>
         
         <p>The birth of twin boys to Roberts and his first
		  wife, Bertha Fowles Roberts, bore significance due to the
		  apparent local tribal custom calling for twins to be killed
		  at birth, as they were viewed as portents of evil that
		  would cause the deaths of their parents. The Robertses
		  provided an example in opposition to this custom, resulting
		  in increased acceptance of twins in the region. Bertha
		  Fowles Roberts (1883-1957), a native of Oregon, had
		  responsibility for mission bookkeeping and other office
		  duties, as well as teaching and organizing women's
		  conferences. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The George Arthur Roberts Family Papers span the
		  years from 1884 until the late 1970s (primarily the first
		  half of the twentieth century), and consist largely of
		  visual documents, including photographs, photograph albums,
		  slides, and negatives; a collection of postcards and a
		  small amount of printed material are also included. While
		  the majority of the images are unidentified, they provide a
		  rich and extensive pictorial record of the activities of
		  pioneer Methodist missionaries, the early missions they
		  established, and the personal experience and growth of one
		  missionary family in this setting. George Arthur Roberts'
		  memoir 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Let Me Tell You a
		  Story...</title>, copies of which are included in the
		collection, describes life as lived by these early
		missionaries and contrasts them with conditions in 1964,
		the time of its writing. In addition to documenting aspects
		of missionary history, the Roberts papers also depict the
		landscapes and peoples of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and
		surrounding areas, particularly the Umtali region (now
		Mutare), at a time when they remained relatively untouched
		by western influence. The Papers are organized into the
		following series based on format: the <emph render="bold">Photographic Prints Series</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Postcards Series</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Printed Material Series</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Negatives Series</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Slides Series</emph>, and the
		<emph render="bold">Photograph Albums Series</emph>.</p>
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Photographic Prints
		  Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Slides
		  Series</emph> comprise the bulk of the collection. Both
		  series have been organized into the following subseries:
		  <emph render="bold">People</emph>, <emph render="bold">Mission Activities</emph>, and
		  <emph render="bold">African Scenes/Landscapes</emph>. The
		  <emph render="bold">People Subseries</emph> contains
		  numerous portraits of African men, women, and children;
		  missionaries; and primarily the Roberts family themselves,
		  including photos likely taken on various trips both within
		  Africa and to other locations including the United States,
		  Europe, and Asia. Of particular note in the
		  <emph render="bold">People Subseries</emph> are a group of
		  prints of the visit of the British Queen Mother and
		  Elizabeth II to Melsetter Junction in 1948. The
		  <emph render="bold">Mission Activities Subseries</emph>
		  contains images of such school- and church-related events
		  as conferences and gatherings, construction of mission
		  buildings, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Some of the
		  original prints used to illustrate Roberts' 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Let Me Tell You A
		  Story...</title> can also be found. <emph> There is little
		overlap, in terms of identical images, between the prints
		and slides series.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Negatives Series</emph>
		  contains 27 rolls of 35mm film, likely dating from the
		  1950s, from which contact sheets have been made. While the
		  contact sheets are open for research, the master negative
		  rolls themselves are closed to patron use. The series also
		  includes some cut 35mm negative frames and a few
		  medium-format negatives which are open for research. The
		  subject matter of the negatives is similar to that of the
		  <emph render="bold">Photographic Prints Series</emph> and
		  the <emph render="bold">Slides Series</emph>. The majority
		  of the images in this series do not appear to duplicate
		  images found in previous series.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photograph Album
		  Series</emph> consists of three bound photograph albums,
		  containing a rich variety of images. The collection also
		  includes an extensive <emph render="bold">Postcards
		  Series</emph>, 1918-1965 and undated, from locations
		  largely within Africa but also in Europe, Asia, and North
		  America. The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials
		  Series</emph> contains two copies of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Let Me Tell You A
		  Story...</title>, George Arthur Roberts' memoir, and other
		mission-related material.</p>

                  <p>This subseries is the largest, and includes
				  portraits of African men, women, and children;
				  missionaries; and primarily the Roberts family themselves.
				  The Roberts family portraits cover not only their time in
				  Rhodesia, but also include later locations and generations.
				  Tudor and Mary Elma Roberts both married and had children;
				  Tudor and his wife, Emelie Roberts, stayed in Africa as
				  missionaries, while Mary Roberts married Richard Clark and
				  settled initially in Hawaii. The earliest photographs are
				  albumen prints of Bertha Fowles as an infant and of her
				  parents.</p>

                     <emph render="bold">People</emph> also
				  includes photos likely taken by the Robertses on various
				  trips to the United States, including a visit to Mary Elma
				  in Hawaii, Asia, Europe, Australia, and other locations.
				  Also of note are a group of prints of the visit of the
				  British Queen Mother and Elizabeth II to Melsetter Junction
				  in 1948, where they were introduced to George Roberts.</p>

               <p>The majority of the postcards depict African
				locations, including Umtali, Salisbury, and other areas in
				Rhodesia; Cape Town, East London, and Gordon's Bay in South
				Africa; Gordon's Bay; and Victoria Falls. A few also
				feature Africans, wildlife, and mission scenes. Other
				postcards are from locations outside Africa, presumably
				reflecting the Roberts family's travels. Locales include
				Hong Kong, Europe (England, France, Portugal, and Italy),
				the Middle East, the United States, Canada, Trinidad, and
				St. Lucia. Significantly, a small number of postcards in
				the series were written and mailed, primarily to/from Lulu
				Tubbs Roberts and Bertha Fowles Roberts. They pertain
				mostly to travel and family news, and provide examples of
				first-person written observation otherwise scarce in the
				collection (outside of G. A. Roberts' published book).</p>
