         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>SHARE (Student Housing for Academic and
		  Residential Experimentation) was founded in 1970 as an
		  academically elite experimental living group of 54 men and
		  women. The integrated residence, then known as the
		  Experimental College, was part of Duke's "New Curriculum".
		  The "New Curriculum" recommendations of 1969 had suggested
		  various changes in living arrangements for students on
		  campus, including the elimination of freshmen dormitories
		  and the establishment of a co-educational dormitory.</p>
         
         <p>SHARE generally included students who were
		  creative and possessed special talents or interests. SHARE
		  applicants also had to demonstrate a clear sense of
		  academic direction, and show interest in helping develop
		  programs of the Experimental College within the first year.
		  Students enrolled in Program II, an interdisciplinary study
		  program, were given preference to live in the SHARE
		  house.</p>
         
         <p>The first director, overseeing the academic
		  progress of residents, was English professor John Clum.
		  Clum worked closely with the administration of Duke
		  University to blend SHARE's social and academic components
		  into a sustainable living environment. SHARE was first
		  located in the Faculty Apartments (now Wilson House) on
		  Duke University's East Campus. The apartment-type layout of
		  the building allowed for men and women to live closely
		  together while preserving privacy. SHARE participants lived
		  in Wilson House until 1982, then in Alspaugh House from
		  1983 to 1984. In 1984, SHARE moved again to Epworth Inn,
		  where it would remain until 1997. In 1997, SHARE was moved
		  to Wilson House. </p>
         
         <p>SHARE programming consisted of a variety of
		  seminars, credit courses, meetings, film festivals, and
		  lectures. Events included a "Use Your Appendages" Party,
		  Anime Fest, Epworth Prom (Oil My Lizard), The Epworth
		  Retreat, and "Twilight", a rave. Two of the most notable
		  activities were SHARE hours and Pedagogo. SHARE hours gave
		  members of the dorm an opportunity to tell others about
		  their interest and experiences. Pedagogo was a series of
		  events where members of the Duke University faculty were
		  invited to Epworth to speak informally about issues in
		  research and academics. </p>
         
         <p>In 1995, SHARE became the first living group on
		  campus to include members from all four undergraduate
		  years. SHARE persisted as an alternative to conventional
		  Duke residential life. When cited for low membership in
		  1997, SHARE was relocated from Epworth House to the third
		  floor in Wilson House. As of 2003, SHARE is active at Duke
		  University.</p>
