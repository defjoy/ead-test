         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Southgate-Jones family papers, 1794-1990s (bulk 1912-1933), are
largely comprised of both business and personal correspondence, but also
include printed material; photographs; genealogical information; business
records in the form of volumes, reports, and minutes of meetings; clippings;
and legal and financial papers. Several generations of Southgate and Jones
family members are represented, including James Southgate, James H.
Southgate, Mattie Logan Southgate Jones and James Southgate ("South")
Jones. These individuals were involved in business, educational, political,
civic, social and cultural activities in Durham and North Carolina during the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Areas include insurance, real
estate and tobacco businesses, banking, the administration of Trinity College,
the women's suffrage movement, the Durham Civic Association, and Durham
Masonic Lodge No. 352. The collection is useful for studying the history of
Durham and North Carolina, the regional application of national policy
toward farmers during the 1920s and 1930s, and the family history of
prominent citizens.</p>
         
         <p>A significant portion of the collection was generated by James Southgate
Jones as President of the North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank of Durham.
This organization was one of twelve created by the Federal Farm Loan Act of
1916, to encourage farmers to purchase land with low interest, long term
loans financed by the sale of stocks and bonds to investors. The bank was
liquidated in 1942. The majority of correspondence dating before 1930 in the
North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank of Durham Series contains documents
relating to the sale of farm land in North Carolina and, to a much lesser
extent, Virginia; the financing of loans; and, after 1930, the increasingly harsh
economic situation farmers faced as banks foreclosed on their loans. There is
also discussion of foreclosure policies, relief programs, and the Hull-Wolcott
Bill of 1933 in later correspondence. Included are communications with
investment brokers in New York and Boston, property owners, real estate
agents in North Carolina and elsewhere, prospective clients, banks in North
Carolina and other states, and to a lesser extent the United States Treasury
Department. There is also correspondence between James Southgate Jones,
other officers of the bank and members of its Board of Directors. The series
contains some financial reports from other land banks in Nebraska, Chicago,
California, and Washington, D.C. Also included in the financial papers
subseries are: lists of property owned, money loaned, farms for sale, farms
purchased, and foreclosures; receipts for the sale of land and stock; balance
sheets; and bank expenditures.</p>
         
         <p>Other family business endeavors are documented in the Correspondence
and Business Records Series. Both series contain information about the
business endeavors of tobacco merchant T.D. Jones, including letters and
notes from tobacco merchants throughout the Southeast who sold his
products. Volumes in the Business Records Series record the financial affairs
of J. Southgate and Son, an insurance agency begun by James Southgate and
later headed by James H. Southgate; agencies affiliated with J. Southgate and
Son; and Southgate Jones and Company Real Estate, headed by James
Southgate Jones. Scattered Correspondence, 1890s- early 1910s, and a
letterbook of James H. Southgate (1901-1906), relating to J. Southgate and
Son, concern these businesses. As President of Southgate Jones and
Company Real Estate, James Southgate Jones handled property in North
Carolina, such as farmland and Durham homes and businesses as well as
property in Virginia and New York. The bulk of the Correspondence
between 1912 and 1914 deals with the promotion of North Carolina land to
prospective buyers, especially in the North and West; and efforts of
businessmen to make deals with Jones. These letters may be useful for
examining the development of Durham between 1910 and 1920. There is
limited correspondence regarding early land stock business unaffiliated with
the North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank of Durham.</p>
         
         <p>Information on the civic and political activities of family members is
located in the Correspondence, Printed Material, Writings and Speeches and
Miscellaneous Series. Correspondence, particularly after 1916, was generated
almost exclusively by Mattie Southgate Jones's involvement in the Durham
Civic Association and a variety of women's clubs. The Miscellaneous Series
contains materials relating to her involvement with the North Carolina State
Fair, suffrage, and a Durham campaign for a waste disposal program.
Correspondence about the suffrage campaign, 1918-1922, discusses soliciting
names for petition drives, lobbying state senators, and political strategy and
organization. Mrs. Jones was responsible for petition drives on the Trinity
College campus. Other suffragist leaders with whom she frequently
corresponded include Gertrude Weil, who served as Vice President and
President of the North Carolina Equal Suffrage Association. A letterbook
(1897-1902) kept by James Southgate concerns his involvement with the
Masons, Elks and Templars. In addition to a small number of letters
pertaining to his insurance business, the bulk are to other Lodge members
and pertain to the Grand Chapter, the national organization and other
business of Durham Masonic Lodge No. 352, including the sponsorship of an
Orphan Asylum in Oxford, North Carolina. James H. Southgate's letterbook
(1901-1906) contains a small amount of correspondence, 1903-1904,
concerning his position as a Trustee of Trinity College, and includes
discussion of the Bassett affair and the formation of Greensboro Women's
College.</p>
         
         <p>The extensive genealogical research of Mattie Southgate Jones is located
in the Correspondence, Genealogy, Pictures and Miscellaneous Series.
Additional information on family members can be found in the Clippings,
Legal Papers and Financial Papers Series. The majority of letters written in
the Correspondence Series between 1922 and 1934 consist of contacts made
by relatives in North Carolina and elsewhere, in response to Mrs. Jones's
queries. The largest amount of material relates to the Jeffreys, Jones,
Southgate, and Wynne families. Photographs in the Pictures Series
correspond to written information, and often unidentified loose photographs
can be matched to labeled ones in albums.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence Series contains a small amount of commentary,
1861-1863, on the Civil War, including letters from family members serving
with the 1st North Carolina Cavalry Regiment. One letter includes an account
by a civilian of the Union cavalry expedition from New Bern to Tarboro and
Rocky Mount, North Carolina in July, 1863. The series also contains
correspondence between family and friends. Included are a number of letters,
1906-1930, between James Southgate Jones ("South") and his uncle James
H. Southgate, mother Mattie Southgate Jones, and brother Lyell Jones,
written while he was away at school or traveling. Letters, 1909-1910, that
South and Lyell wrote during a trip out West describe new surroundings,
particularly New Mexico. There are also letters from South, Mattie, and
other family members to Lyell from 1912-1913, during his extended illness
and stay at the Winyah Sanatorium in Asheville, N.C. Other correspondents
include James Southgate and Celestia Muse Southgate Simmons.</p>
         
         <p>The collection also includes lantern slides, tintypes, daguerrotypes, and
cartes-de-visites in the Picture Series. Subjects include family members and
Durham businesses, streets and homes in the late nineteenth and
early-twentieth centuries.</p>
         
         <p>Additions to the collection have not been interfiled, and include business records, photographs, scrapbooks, a cookbook, and autobiographies of some family members. Please consult the detailed list below for more information.</p>
         
         <p>The papers of James Southgate (1832-1914) form a separate collection in
the Duke University Special Collections Department. Collections in the Duke
University Archives related to the career of James Haywood Southgate
include the William Preston Few Papers, the Trinity College Board of
Trustee Papers, and the John Carlisle Kilgo Papers.</p>
