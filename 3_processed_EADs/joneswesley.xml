         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>This collection contains two letters (1918-1919)
		  from Wesley Norwood Jones to his son, Lt. William Bailey
		  Jones, of the Field Artillery of the American Expeditionary
		  Forces in France. There are also letters to and from S. B.
		  Jones, a medical officer in the British West Indies. These
		  letters are accompanied by ten 
		  photographs of victims of a
		  recent smallpox epidemic. There are three letters (1938)
		  from Dr. W. S. Parsons of Shanghai. He mentions the
		  Sino-Japanese conflict and some of his personal
		  experiences. Several letters are from William Bailey Jones,
		  Jr., written while he was a soldier in WWII.</p>
         
         <p> This collection also includes two volumes, the
		  first of which is a scrapbook kept by the Jones family. The
		  scrapbook contains clippings on the political activities
		  and death of Thomas Jones Pence of Raleigh, who in 1912 was
		  put in charge of publicity for the Democratic National
		  Committee. There are also clippings on the deaths of Wesley
		  N. Jones, his son William Bailey Jones, and Mrs. William N.
		  Jones. William Bailey Jones was in training at Camp Jackson
		  before he went overseas. The scrapbook contains a number of
		  photographs of doughboys training there, of their movement
		  around France, and of their being reviewed by Pershing and
		  Roosevelt in Dec. 1918. Additionally, there are clippings
		  about the senatorial campaign in 1930, in which Josiah W.
		  Bailey, brother-in-law and partner of Wesley N. Jones,
		  defeated Senator Simmons. At the end of the scrapbook is a
		  pamphlet entitled 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">How the War Came</title> (June
		15, 1917). The second volume is an unbound handbook of 1941
		or 1942 for Bible teachers in the public schools of
		N.C.</p>
