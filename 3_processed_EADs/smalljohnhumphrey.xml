         <abstract>Lawyer and U.S. Representative from North
        Carolina. Correspondence, legal documents, and other papers (chiefly
        1850-1870 and 1912-1937) of John Humphrey Small; of his father-in-law, Col. Rufus W.
        Wharton, lawyer and planter; and of Col. David M. Carter, lawyer, planter, businessman, and
        court official, of Fairfield, N.C. Small's papers form the bulk of the collection and
        concern his North Carolina agricultural interests, his legal practice, his activities in
        Congress, river and harbor improvements, the Intracoastal Waterway, patronage, Southern
        financial conditions, U.S. and North Carolina politics, World War I labor problems, and the
        1929 Depression. The papers before 1850 are mainly deeds, family papers, and legal
        documents. Wharton's and Carter's papers relate largely to the legal profession and to their
        agricultural interests.</abstract>
