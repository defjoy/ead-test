         <p>Richard Halleck Brodhead became Duke's ninth president on July 1, 2004, after a 32-year career at Yale University.  In addition to serving as president, he is a professor of English at Duke.  Born in Dayton, Ohio, he graduated from Yale in 1968 and received his Ph.D. there in 1972.  He then joined the Yale faculty, where he became the A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor of English and American Studies.  After serving as chair of Yale's Department of English for six years, Brodhead was named dean of Yale College in 1993 and served in the post for 11 years until he assumed Duke's presidency.  His writings as dean are collected in The Good of This Place:  Values and Challenges in College Education.  He was presented with the 2006 Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal by the Yale Graduate School Alumni Association.  </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
