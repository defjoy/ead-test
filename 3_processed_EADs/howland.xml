         <abstract>Families originally from Carteret and Moore Counties, N.C. Correspondence; legal files, including deeds and wills; photographs; many genealogical materials; financial papers; postcards; paper currency; two scrapbooks; and school papers, all relating to the Howland and the McIntosh families from Carteret, Durham, and Moore Counties, N.C. Photographs include tintypes, albumen prints, and one daguerrotype. Many legal files pertain to a lengthy court case involving the transfer of family property on Shackleford Banks, N.C. to the federal government. Oversize materials include aerial photographs and land surveys of Shackleford Banks and other family properties, and photostats of early deeds.

Though several photographs and all the currency date from the Civil War, the only other original documentation on the families' Civil War activities is a signed oath of allegiance to the Union dated 1865, and a few letters referring at length to the circumstances surrounding the confiscation of one Howland's property in Beaufort, N.C. during the war, and his attempts at legal restitution.
William F. Howland (1876-1951) married Mary Elizabeth McIntosh (1878-1964) in 1903. The collection contains much of their correspondence. Other correspondence includes World War I letters from a McIntosh son, Leland Carson.

The addition (04-129)(25 items, 1.5 lin. ft.; dated [1870s]-[1960s]) consists primarily of materials, including a scrapbook, photo album, letters, and travel journals, kept by Mary Howland Dawson from the 1950 "Youth Caravan to Germany" sponsored by the Methodist Conference of North Carolina. Also includes two family photograph albums, with images dating back to the 1870s; clippings about various family members; and an historical sketch of Salem United Methodist Church in Garland, N.C. This addition is unprocessed and is not represented in the finding aid.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Howland-McIntosh Family Papers span the years
		  1713-1997, with the bulk of the papers being dated from
		  1830-1989. They chronicle the personal lives and business
		  affairs of three North Carolina families: the Howlands, the
		  McIntoshes, and, to a much lesser extent, the Dawsons. The
		  Howlands settled in Carteret County in the early eighteenth
		  century, buying properties in and near Beaufort and on the
		  Shackleford Banks. Their occupations included sea captains,
		  millers, carpenters, small farmers, and insurance agents.
		  Howland descendants married members of the McIntosh family,
		  who were then living in Moore County. Eventually,
		  descendants of these families moved briefly into Durham
		  County in the late 19th/early 20th centuries. The Dawson
		  family represented in this collection is related by
		  marriage to the Howland-McIntosh family, and a descendant
		  still lives in Durham County. The collection is rich in
		  documents relating to the history of Carteret County, N.C.
		  from the early 18th to the late 20th centuries, especially
		  relating to the Outer Banks, including Shackleford Banks,
		  now part of the Cape Lookout National Seashore. Eighteenth
		  and nineteenth century legal papers in the collection
		  chiefly document early land ownership, and there are also
		  many family wills.</p>
         
         <p>The collection consists of correspondence, legal
		  papers, financial papers, photographs -- including
		  daguerreotypes, tintypes, and albumen prints, printed
		  materials such as periodicals and posters, school records
		  and compositions, scrapbooks, postcards, stereograph cards,
		  and a few artifacts. The bulk of the collection is made up
		  of correspondence and many legal papers, especially deeds
		  and indentures. There is little material directly
		  concerning the Civil War in this collection; however,
		  information on the families' activities during this period
		  can be found in 20th century sources in the genealogical
		  materials folders.</p>
         
         <p>Family relationships and daily personal matters
		  are documented in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence
		  Series,</emph> which includes a long series of love letters
		  written from 1903-1904 between William F. Howland II and
		  Mary McIntosh Howland. Another series of letters originated
		  from Leland C. McIntosh during his military service in
		  World War I, chiefly in France and Belgium. These mainly
		  concern routine family matters, but give some insight into
		  camp life and the effect of the war on the soldiers. Leland
		  also sent home souvenirs of his stay, including a 1914 Iron
		  Cross which is housed in the <emph render="bold">Artifacts
		  Series,</emph> along with a 1893 pin from Grover
		  Cleveland's presidential inauguration. Other principal
		  correspondents include William F. Howland, Sr., Ralph
		  Howland, and Emma J. Howland; the remaining correspondents
		  include several other family members and friends. Other
		  family correspondence is located in the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series</emph> and the
		  <emph render="bold">Shackleford Banks (N.C.) Legal Papers
		  Series.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>Documents pertaining to specific members of these
		  families and their financial and legal activities,
		  particularly land ownership and household expenses, can be
		  found in two family series. The <emph render="bold">Howland
		  Family Series</emph> contains folders for papers grouped by
		  various family members: Ralph Howland (1793-1866) and his
		  wife Eliza Bell Howland (1810-1883); Zephaniah Howland
		  (1752-1834?); Levi C. Howland (1834-?); and Emma J. Howland
		  (1851-1920). Contents include deeds, mortgages, indentures,
		  bills, receipts, estate papers, and a few recipes for home
		  remedies. The Zephaniah Howland folder contains three
		  petitions (1832-33) relating to his request for a military
		  pension based on his participation in the Revolutionary
		  War; these documents contain numerous details of his
		  service. The Levi C. Howland folder contains an oath of
		  allegiance to the Union signed by William F. Howland in
		  1865. Another mention of the impact of the Civil War on the
		  Howlands is a document in the Ralph Howland legal papers
		  which records his petition in 1866 to have confiscated
		  property in Beaufort town restored to his rightful
		  ownership. Also in this series is genealogical information
		  on the Howland family, who descended from Henry Howland,
		  brother of John Howland, original Mayflower passenger. The
		  <emph render="bold">McIntosh Family Series</emph> contains
		  legal papers (chiefly deeds); McIntosh children's school
		  records, including many compositions; numerous clippings;
		  obituaries; a few wills; and other information on family
		  members.</p>
         
         <p>Further information on the Howland, McIntosh, and
		  Dawson families can be obtained from the two albums in the
		  <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series.</emph> A McIntosh
		  album chiefly records through the medium of commercial
		  postcards Leland McIntosh's travels in Europe during the
		  period 1917-1919. Some offer scenes of military camp life
		  in Camp Greenleaf, Ga., and in France; others display
		  routine views of Belgium, and the Italian and French
		  rivieras. There are also some greeting cards, chiefly from
		  the 1920s. The second album belonged to the Howland family
		  and conveys many insights into the family's lives during
		  the 20th century. Several descendants were alumni of Duke
		  University; their academic and social activities there are
		  documented through clippings, commencement booklets, and
		  other Items. Other materials mounted in this album include
		  many pieces of correspondence, photographs, postcards, war
		  ration booklets, and greeting cards. Many postcards in both
		  of these albums present views of 19th and 20th-century N.C.
		  coastal areas. Other postcards can also be found in the
		  <emph render="bold">Postcards Series.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Shackleford Banks (N.C.)
		  Series</emph> concerns a lengthy legal process transferring
		  ownership of the Howland property on Shackleford Banks,
		  N.C. to the federal government. The series is divided into
		  two subseries: the <emph render="bold">Legal Papers
		  Subseries</emph> contains all legal files from the
		  attorney's offices, while the much smaller
		  <emph render="bold">Family Papers Subseries</emph>
		  originated from the family's own personal files. The
		  litigation began in 1959 and ended in 1985 with the
		  inclusion of the Shackleford Banks in the Cape Lookout
		  National Seashore, and is richly documented in this
		  collection through attorney-client and family
		  correspondence, many deeds, land surveys and appraisals,
		  court records, genealogical records, other legal and
		  financial papers, and clippings. Researchers interested in
		  the history of the Outer Banks of N.C. will be interested
		  to find many photostats and photocopies of early Carteret
		  County deeds and other legal papers, including a Lords
		  Proprietor land grant to John Porter dated 1713. Many of
		  these Items have been stored in the oversize materials
		  section.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs and Artifacts
		  Series</emph> provides portraits of family members from
		  circa 1860 to the mid-20th century, including some in
		  Confederate uniform. Most of the individuals, however, are
		  unidentified. Also included in this series are a small
		  group of early twentieth century stereograph cards, and a
		  few artifacts.</p>

               <p>The largest series in the collection documents
				the lengthy and complicated legal proceedings, beginning in
				the
				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1960/1969" type="inclusive">1960s</unitdate>and
				ending in
				<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1989" type="inclusive">1989,</unitdate>which transferred land on Shackleford Banks,
				N.C., from private owners to the federal government for
				inclusion in the Cape Lookout National Seashore. The series
				is divided into two subseries as found in the original
				collection, Legal Papers and Family Papers, both of which
				consist mainly of attorney-client correspondence, court
				documents, and many pieces of documentary evidence used in
				the case, such as land surveys and deeds.</p>
               
               <p>There are many photocopies of original
				documents from the 18th and 19th centuries, chiefly deeds
				documenting land ownership on the Shackleford Banks,
				Carteret County. The earliest of these is a photostat of a
				land grant from the Lords Proprietors to John Porter, 1713.
				Materials are not arranged chronologically, but were kept
				in the original order imposed on them by the attorneys'
				offices and the Howland family. Many items in this series
				are found in the oversize section of the collection. All
				folder titles were taken from the file labels created by
				the attorneys' offices and the Howland family. Annotations
				from attorney's folders are also noted on the front of the
				file folders.</p>

               <p>Two scrapbooks belonging to the McIntosh and
				Howland families. They contain many varieties of
				memorabilia, including: correspondence; postcards; greeting
				cards, including some Valentines; clippings; photographs;
				stock certificates; receipts; rail passes; commencement
				programs and other school mementos; World War II ration
				books; and the will of Mary McIntosh Howland. A series of
				postcards from World War I was sent by Leland C. McIntosh
				to his family, and depict scenes of camp life and portraits
				of notable military leaders; many more are from the years
				just after World War I, and show views of France, Belgium,
				the French Riviera, and Italy. Other postcards from the
				early 20th century show views of Beaufort and Henderson,
				N.C. Items in scrapbooks are arranged in rough
				chronological order by year.</p>
