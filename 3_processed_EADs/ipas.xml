               <p>Ipas's first Latin America/Caribbean (LAC) programs began in Mexico in 1983 with demonstration training projects in MVA technique for treating abortion complications.  Extensive programs, primarily in training for women's reproductive health service delivery and health systems research, were conducted starting in the late 1980s.  The primary LAC program countries from 1987 - 2003 were Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil and Bolivia (all of which had in-country Ipas offices over this time period), with smaller projects at various times in Peru, Paraguay, Colombia and Chile. Ipas has sold MVA instruments throughout the entire continent. By the mid-1990s, Ipas stepped up efforts in policy and marketing in the LAC region, as overall organizational capacity was enhanced in these areas.  
 
</p>
               
               <p>Areas of highest impact and results in the LAC region by Ipas include: assisting governments in national scale-up of post abortion care initiatives to improve quality of and access to treatment of abortion complications, contributing to reductions in maternal mortality; research cost studies on services; quality of care and instructional tools for improving post abortion care services and preventing repeat abortion via post abortion family planning; establishing legal abortion services where laws have allowed; provision of post abortion care services by mid-level and primary care providers; reproductive health services for adolescents; publicizing the issue of sexual violence against women; and advancement of women's sexual and reproductive rights as part of human rights.</p>
               
               <p>Ipas's LAC programs were under the direction of various staff during this time period - most notably Harrison McKay (Director of Programs in the late 1980s), Joan Healy (Director of Programs in the 1990s), and Virginia Chambers, Ipas's first LAC Desk Director (regional director) beginning in 1998.

               <p>Ipas was founded in 1973 to complete development of the Manual Vacuum Aspirator (MVA) technology and to undertake its distribution worldwide with the overarching goal of ending women's preventable deaths and disabilities from unsafe abortion.  Ipas focused its MVA marketing and distribution efforts on the product's attributes as a safe, low cost medical instrument appropriate for all types of health care facilities, especially low-resource and outpatient settings where trained mid- and lower-level clinical providers (in addition to physicians) could provide these critical services for women.</p>
               
               <p>Ipas dedicated staff to its MVA marketing efforts starting in the early 1990s.  Starting in 1997, major grants allowed the organization to greatly expand marketing efforts by hiring marketing professionals, undertaking country-based marketing activities to improve local access and supply, positioning MVA as a safe and appropriate alternative to other post-abortion and abortion methodologies, forming private and public partnerships for product distribution, performing more sophisticated market segmentation analyses, expanding the product line, and increasing training options and tools.  Sales and distribution of MVA increased dramatically accordingly, resulting in more women being served worldwide.  Ipas also re-designed the MVA aspirator to make it more durable, easier to use and maintain, and lower in cost; the new MVA was launched in 2004.</p>
               
               <p>Ipas's marketing efforts were under the direction of various staff during this time period. Katie Early (McLaurin) headed up marketing activities in the 1980s, and Jennifer Potts was International Marketing Associate in the 1990s.  Starting in 1997, Kim Beer was the first Director of Marketing and Gil Barner joined in 2000 as Vice President of Reproductive Health Technologies.  The unit was renamed Technology and Logistics (T&amp;L), followed by Product, Promotion and Distribution (PPD) between 2000 and 2004.  Darryl Rubenchik became Vice President of PPD in 2002, followed by Nadine Burton in 2003 and Jay Drosin in 2004.</p>

               <p>Ipas's first Africa programs involved establishment of clinics for treatment of women's complications resulting from incomplete abortion and provision of contraceptives in Ghana in 1981.  In 1983, Ipas sponsored demonstration training projects in Nigeria in MVA technique for treating complications resulting from incomplete abortion.  Hospital-based MVA training projects followed in Nigeria, Zaire, Zambia, Kenya in the late 1980s, and research projects commenced in the early 1990s in Zimbabwe and Kenya.  Starting in the mid-1990s, Ipas programs in Africa expanded dramatically, due to donor grants dedicated to organizational efforts in east and southern Africa, along with growth in overall organizational capacity in policy/advocacy and marketing.  In 2000, Ipas established the Africa Alliance for Reproductive Health and Rights to coordinate and support country- and region-wide activities and extend programming to countries where Ipas did not have a country office.  By 2000, Ipas had in-country offices in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Ghana and South Africa, and a regional office in Kenya for the Ipas Africa Alliance.  Ipas sold MVA instruments throughout the entire continent during this time period.</p>
               
               <p>Areas of highest impact and results in the Africa region by Ipas include: assisting governments in national scale-up of postabortion care initiatives to improve quality of and access to treatment of abortion complications; conducting health systems and cost research studies on services; developing quality of care and instructional tools for improving postabortion care services and preventing repeat abortion via postabortion family planning; establishing comprehensive abortion care services in countries where laws were supportive; creating national standards and guidelines for best practices in comprehensive abortion care; advocating for reform to expand legal indications for abortion services; documenting coverage and utilization models in safe abortion care; provision of postabortion care services by mid-level and primary care providers; provision of reproductive health services for special needs populations, such as refugees, adolescents and people with HIV/AIDS; and advancement of women's sexual and reproductive rights as part of human rights.</p>
               
               <p>Ipas's Africa programs were under the direction of various staff during this time period - most notably Harrison McKay (Director of Programs in the late 1980s), Joan Healy (Director of Programs in the 1990s), Jennifer Potts (Africa Desk Director, or regional director) and Khama Rogo (Vice President for Africa and VP for Medical Affairs) in the late 1990s, Eunice Brookman-Amissah (Vice President for Africa and Director of Ipas Africa Alliance) starting in 2000, and Uche Ekenna as Africa Desk Director starting in 2003.</p>

               <p>Ipas began its work in Asia in 1985 in Turkey with the supply of MVA instruments to the Ministry of Health, followed by trainings of medical providers to expand and improve menstrual regulations services.  Shortly thereafter, Ipas supplied instruments and developed interventions to improve infection prevention in the Bangladesh menstrual regulation program.  In Vietnam, Ipas was part of the Reproductive Health Project starting in 1994 with Pathfinder International and AVSC (now EngenderHealth), and Ipas Vietnam opened its own office in 2000.  Vietnam programs focused on assisting the Ministry of Health in developing National Abortion Standards and Guidelines, and expanding access to comprehensive abortion care services, including safe, high quality second trimester abortion services.  In India, Ipas played a strategic role in putting safe abortion on the national reproductive health agenda with a seminal conference on safe abortion in Agra in October 2000.  With a major private grant, Ipas opened an office in New Delhi in 2001.  After the law change in Nepal in 2002 to legalize abortion services, Ipas provided technical assistance in the development of policy guidelines, and planning and implementing the safe abortion program.  Ipas's programs in Vietnam, India and Nepal expanded dramatically from 2000 - 2006.  Ipas provided technical and training support to start comprehensive abortion care services in Cambodia in 2004 and began developing programmatic plans in Pakistan in 2006.</p>
               
               <p>Ipas's main strategy in Asia was to work in countries where abortion was legal to remove barriers to access and demonstrate models of quality comprehensive abortion care, including medication abortion primarily in India and Vietnam.  Asian countries presented great potential for impact to improve women's lives through public sector programs and integration with other reproductive health initiatives.</p>
               
               <p>Don Weeden was Ipas's Regional Desk (Director) for Asia Programs starting in 1999, followed by Traci Baird in 2002, and Wendy Darby in 2005.

               <p>Progressive abortion policies are critical for women to be able to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights and have access to comprehensive, woman-centered abortion care.  In 1995, Ipas acquired the first dedicated funding to broaden efforts in the area of support for policy reform which allowed the formation of a technical unit with dedicated staff.</p>
               
               <p>Areas of focus and impact for Ipas's policy work include: integrating abortion into the agendas of other organizations working in the areas of health, human rights, and empowerment of women, including advocacy with professional associations such as the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO); advocating for the full implementation and liberal interpretation of current abortion laws; supporting local groups advocating for reforming restrictive abortion laws; supporting and creating social movements at all levels (global, regional, national) for sexual and reproductive health and rights, with a focus on safe abortion; building youth leadership and capacity in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion; and monitoring and countering anti-choice activism.</p>
               
               <p>Of note is Ipas's work with multilateral agencies such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations. In 1998 Ipas gained Special Consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations which allowed for participation in international conferences and other UN forums.  Ipas staff have worked since then with the broader NGO community to advocate for progressive language in UN agreements on sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion. The Ipas policy unit has also focused thematic work on neglected issues including the intersection of unwanted pregnancy and abortion with women living with HIV/AIDS, adolescents, violence against women, and human rights.  Ipas's policy work on administrative barriers in laws and policies helped shape the policy recommendations in the groundbreaking WHO guidance on safe abortion issued first in 2003.  Ipas's policy work was created and developed under the direction of Charlotte Hord Smith.
