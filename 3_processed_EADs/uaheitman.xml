         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>John Franklin Heitman was born on April 17, 1840 in Davidson County, North Carolina, the
		  son of Henry and Eve McRary Heitman. He entered Trinity College in Randolph County in 1861, but
		  left in 1862 to join the Confederate Army. He served as a captain in the Civil War. After the war,
		  following a short period of business and teaching, he retuned to Trinity and received an A.M.
		  degree in 1868. He then resumed teaching and became a clergyman in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
		  South, and held several parishes. In 1881, he left the clergy to enter business in Chapel Hill,
		  establishing the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Educational Journal</title>, which he called "the organ
		of the North Carolina State Teachers Association."</p>
         
         <p>During this time period, he met and married Emma Carr, sister of the Durham tobacco
		  manufacturer Julian S. Carr. In 1883, he was appointed a professor at Trinity College and moved,
		  along with the Education Journal, back to Randolph County. Much of his time over then next few
		  years was spent in dealing with the financial problems of the school. After Marquis Lafayette Wood
		  resigned from the presidency of Trinty in December 1884, Heitman served as an interim head of the
		  school in his capacity as chairman of the faculty. Along with the Committee of Management--his
		  brother-in-law Carr, J.W. Alspaugh, and James A. Gray--Heitman managed to keep the school
		  financially afloat and increase enrollment. In 1887, a new president, John Franklin Crowell, was
		  chosen to lead Trinity.</p>
         
         <p>In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham County, but Heitman stayed in Randolph County to
		  become Headmaster of Trinity High School. In 1895 he was replaced as headmaster by the Board of
		  Trustees of Trinity College. He then devoted his time to the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Home Journal</title>, and continuing a series of
		articles on North Carolina history that he had begun in the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Educational Journal</title>.</p>
         
         <p>Heitman died on June 15, 1904, and is buried in Trinity Cemetery, Trinity, North Carolina,
		  along with his wife. They had three children: Eva (Mrs. W. Bivens), Polly (Mrs. R.B. Terry), and
		  John.</p>

               <p>The bulk of the correspondence dates from 1883 to 1887, when Heitman was Acting
				President of Trinity College, Randolph County. Issues include fund-raising and support of the
				college. Major correspondents include Julian S. Carr and J. W. Alspaugh, members of the committee
				of management that helped Heitman run the college from 1884 to 1887. As Trinity was one of the
				schools that contracted with the U.S. Government to educate Cherokee Indian youths, this series
				also contains correspondence between Heitman and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of
				the Treasury. Other correspondence is from applicants for positions and applicants for admissions
				to Trinity, correspondence regarding room and board, and letters from parents and prospective
				students.</p>
               
               <p>Other correspondence includes letters written during Heitman's Civil War days;
				correspondence concerning advertising, printing, and publicizing the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Educational Journal</title>, as well as
			 correspondence from subscribers, authors, and publishers; correspondence regarding Trinity High
			 School, and a few family letters. Heitman's correspondence ends in 1894, but the collection
			 contains one letter from 1911, from Heitman's wife to one of his daughters.</p>
