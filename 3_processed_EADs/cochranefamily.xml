         <abstract>Arthur Auckland Leopold
		  Pedro Cochrane served in the British Navy from 1839-1886, where he fought in
		  the Anglo-Chinese war and rose to the rank of admiral. He was also instrumental
		  in administering the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Company during its early years. His
		  brother, Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane was also active in the Royal Navy from
		  1847-1873, participating in the British campaign to suppress the slave trade in
		  West Africa during the 1860s. He was also a landowner and landlord of the
		  Redcastle Estate in County Donegal, Ireland, and served in his later years as
		  High Sheriff for County Donegal. The collection contains correspondence,
		  legal and financial documents, notes and writings, notebooks and diaries,
		  clippings, printed books and pamphlets, photographs, maps, charts, diagrams and
		  technical drawings pertaining to the lives and careers of Arthur Auckland
		  Leopold Pedro and Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane, and to the Trinidad Lake
		  Asphalt Company. The papers span the years 1777-1957, with the bulk of the
		  collection being dated from 1850-1905, and document the naval careers of Arthur
		  Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane and Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane, the role of
		  the Cochrane family as landlords in Western Ulster, and the development of the
		  colonial asphalt industry in Trinidad during the 19th century.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Cochrane Family Papers</emph> span the years
		  1777-1957, with the bulk of the papers being dated between 1850 and 1905. The
		  collection consists of correspondence; legal and financial documents; personal,
		  naval, and technical notes and other writings; notebooks, diaries, and
		  almanacs; clippings and other saved print material; and photographs, maps,
		  charts, drawings, diagrams, and other visual materials preserved by the
		  Cochranes. The majority of these documents pertain to two members of the
		  Cochrane family: the brothers
		  Admiral Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane and

		  Admiral Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane. The bulk of
		  the papers deal with three principal subject areas: the naval careers of the
		  brothers; family matters and finances, particularly the finances of their
		  Redcastle Estate in County Donegal, Ireland; and business papers and
		  correspondence relating to the family estates and the Trinidad Lake Asphalt
		  Company, established by Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, and continued
		  by his son Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane. The collection is
		  particularly rich in documenting the beginnings of the asphalt industry in
		  Trinidad and land-use issues in Ireland during the 19th century. In addition,
		  Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane was stationed off the coast of
		  West Africa during much of the 1850s and 1860s,
		  and the collection contains a number of documents relating to the British
		  attempts during that time to suppress the African slave trade, an effort in
		  which Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane was active. The collection is divided into
		  three series, the <emph render="bold">Family Papers Series</emph>, the
		  <emph render="bold">Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane Series</emph>, and the
		  <emph render="bold">Trinidad Lake Asphalt Series</emph>, each of which are
		  divided into subseries by format. This division retains the original division
		  of the collection, but researchers should be aware that there is significant
		  crossover between the subject areas of the <emph render="bold">Family Papers
		  Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane
		  Series</emph>, and those interested in one of these series should be aware that
		  there may be pertinent material in the other.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Family Papers Series</emph>, the largest of
		  the three, documents two main subject areas: the naval careers of Ernest Grey
		  Lambton and Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane, and the family finances
		  relating to the Redcastle estate. The former of these is documented primarily
		  in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence subseries</emph> and the
		  <emph render="bold">Notes and Writings Subseries</emph>, while the latter is
		  most heavily represented in the <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial
		  Documents Subseries</emph>, which contains a number of rental and account books
		  pertaining to the Cochrane and Doherty family estates in Ireland. The Cochranes
		  were all active inventors, and the <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial
		  Documents Subseries</emph> also includes patent forms for a number of
		  inventions, including means of laying telegraph wire and ships' boilers and
		  propulsion. The <emph render="bold">Notebooks and Diaries Subseries</emph> is
		  comprised primarily of bound volumes of writings by Arthur Auckland Leopold
		  Pedro Cochrane, documenting his daily activity and travels, although it does
		  contain two notebooks used by Thomas Cochrane for surveying during his travels
		  in the 1850s and an Irish Land Commission notebook belonging to Ernest Grey
		  Lambton Cochrane as well. The two remaining subseries, <emph render="bold">Print Materials</emph> and <emph render="bold">Visual Materials
		  and Artifacts</emph>, are much smaller in size, and contain materials
		  pertaining to both brothers, and to the family more generally.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane Series</emph>
		  contains material accessioned separately from the rest of the collection, which
		  documents Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane's naval life and activities off the
		  Western coast of Africa; his correspondence with
		  Richard Doherty (whose daughter he later married)
		  about financial and estate matters in County Donegal; and his time spent as a
		  landlord in County Donegal, where he became High Sheriff and a member of the
		  Grand Jury after retiring from the navy. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
		  Subseries</emph> contains Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane's correspondence with
		  Samuel W. Blackwall of Sierra Leone; Arthur
		  Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane; Thomas Barnes Cochrane; Richard Doherty; and
		  others. Of the other subseries, the <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial
		  Documents</emph> and <emph render="bold">Visual Materials</emph> subseries
		  relate primarily to his life in County Donegal, while the <emph render="bold">Notebooks and Diaries</emph> and <emph render="bold">Notes and
		  Writings</emph> subseries deal more extensively with his earlier naval career
		  and time in West Africa. This series was kept separate from the
		  <emph render="bold">Family Papers Series</emph> to preserve the original order
		  of the documents. As should be clear from this description, however, many of
		  the subject areas of this series overlap with those of the <emph render="bold">Family Papers Series</emph>, and researchers interested in the
		  naval career of Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane or the Cochranes' role as
		  landlords in Northern Ireland should also consult that series.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Trinidad Lake Asphalt Series</emph>
		  documents the Cochrane family's involvement in the early asphalt industry in
		  Trinidad. The vast majority of the papers included here are those of Arthur
		  Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane, who took over the job of overseeing the
		  Cochrane properties and interests in Trinidad after he was invalided during the
		  China wars. However, there are also materials of Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of
		  Dundonald, pertaining to the company. To be found here are business
		  correspondence pertaining to the export of asphalt and bitumen from Trinidad,
		  shipping arrangements, experiments conducted on the potential uses of bitumen
		  from Pitch Lake, and other matters related to the establishment and operation
		  of the business; notes relating to experiments conducted, and to the climate
		  and area; legal documents establishing the company and documenting the extent
		  of the Belle Vue, Mon Plaisir and Esperance Estates in Trinidad; maps and plans
		  of these estates and of Pitch Lake; and two printed volumes and other
		  miscellaneous items pertaining to Trinidad. The material contained in this
		  series should be of interest to those researching the development and early
		  stages of the asphalt industry, and to those interested in colonial business,
