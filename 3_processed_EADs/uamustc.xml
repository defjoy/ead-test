         <bioghist>
            
            <p>The Music Study Club of the Woman's College was organized February 1, 1933 through the offices of Mrs. J. Foster Barnes, Miss Evelyn Barnes and others.  It was formed as an honorary society, with elective membership, for the purpose of recognizing the ambitions and abilities of Duke women in the field of music.  The Club usually had a membership of between 40-50 students.  Meetings were held once a month for the discussion of timely topics in the realm of music. Demonstrations (miniature recitals) were often given by members of the Club or by visitors. The Club presented at least one concert artist or lecturer each year, sometimes in connection with the University Concerts Series. </p>
