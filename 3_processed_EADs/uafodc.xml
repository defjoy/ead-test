         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Friends of Duke Chapel was founded in 1974 to
		  provide the means for interested persons to organize into
		  an ongoing, supportive, participatory group to support the
		  ministry and program of Duke Chapel. The Friends open
		  membership to anyone interested in the Chapel and its
		  program. It grew out of a predecessor group called the Full
		  Membership Chapel Group, organized under and continuing the
		  name of Duke University Church (Interdenominational). Full
		  Members supported the Chapel program but membership was
		  limited to persons affiliated with the University either as
		  faculty or staff. As part of its mission, the Friends of
		  Duke Chapel provide funds to aid numerous aspects of the
		  Chapel program such as the chapel choir, organ, vestments,
		  renovation needs, and provision of televised services.
		  Membership benefits included weekly mailing of the Sunday
		  bulletin, announcements and invitations to services,
		  concerts, and music programs, as well as a Friends of Duke
		  Chapel newsletter. </p>
         
         <p> The Friends have continuously helped fund and
		  contribute to numerous initiatives and renovations of the
		  Chapel, including the construction of a handicapped ramp
		  access to the Chapel, installation of the Flentrop organ,
		  and providing televised access to the Sunday services for
		  patients at Duke Medical Center. They also contributed to
		  enriching the preaching and theologian-in-residence
		  programs. </p>
         
         <p> An Advisory Board governs the group. Originally a
		  nine-person board, it was enlarged to a thirteen person
		  board in 1981, always including the Dean of the Chapel.
		  Past board members include William Stokes, Helen Crotwell,
		  Jack Blackburn, Arthur Kale, William King, Ella Jean Shore,
		  Carolyn Penny, and Mary Parkerson, who became the first
		  Friends Director in 1980. </p>

               <p>This series includes material relating to the
				function of the Friends of Duke Chapel. It is arranged
				alphabetically. Material includes by-laws and resolutions,
				a description and background statement regarding the
				mission of the Friends group, membership lists, and news
				clippings relating to the history of Duke Chapel. In
				addition, there are records from the organizing committee
				relating to the founding of the group and the definition of
				its mission. Of particular interest in this series are the
				oral history transcriptions of interviews conducted by
				Arthur Kale of Barney L. Jones, James T. Cleland, Howard
				Wilkinson, and Robert DuBose. The transcriptions are a rich
				source of historical information on the staff and history
				of the Chapel and its program. The interviews provide
				personal reminiscences of chapel history and staff,
				including Foster Barnes, Mildred Hendrix, Frank Hickman,
				Ben Smith, and the carillonneurs. They discuss their
				relationships with numerous campus organizations,
				athletics, the inter-racial council, and the role of the
				administrative committee. The men remember visits and
				sermons by guest preachers such as Ralph Sockman, Martin
				Niemoller, Henry Crane, and Paul Tillich. They also recall
				chapel events throughout the calendar year including
				Religious Emphasis week, the Christmas pageant, and Easter
				services.
				</p>
               
               <p>Other significant materials are several
				speeches, by Bishop W. Kenneth Goodson, Mary D. B. T.
				Semans, and Marjorie C. Jones respectively, given during
				the Friends annual dinner meeting. Bishop Goodson, former
				Bishop-in-Residence of the Divinity School and trustee
				emeritus of the Duke Endowment, fondly remembers his
				relationship to Duke Chapel. Mary D. B. T. Semans speech
				recalls her mother Sarah P. Duke's feelings for the Chapel,
				and includes her memories of numerous Chapel ministers and
				music staff. Marjorie Jones gives insight into the role of
				chapel hostesses and the life of the chapel during the
				week. [See also: Barney L. Jones Papers for "Chapel
				Reminiscences: The First Two Decades," a speech given to
				the Friends of Duke Chapel Annual Dinner, 1983.]</p>
