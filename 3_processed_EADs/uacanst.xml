         <bioghist>
            
            <p>In 1970, Richard A. Preston (W.K. Boyd Professor of History at Duke and former Professor of History at Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario) was invited to offer a one-semester undergraduate course in Duke University's Distinguished Professor Seminar series.  As a consequence of student interest in the material, a new semester course on the history of Canada was introduced into the regular curriculum.  The Commonwealth Studies Center (founded in 1955) already focused on Canada, and through its fellowship program, it brought one Canadian graduate student to the Duke campus each year.</p>
            
            <p>
In the fall of 1973, the Center for Canadian Studies was established after being awarded grants from the Office of Education and the William H. Donner Foundation.  Conceived as an autonomous unit of Duke's International Studies Center, it worked closely with the Commonwealth Studies Center but remained administratively separate.  The Center's name officially changed to the Center for North American Studies in January 1997.  July 2003 saw the Center's name change once again and the Center for North American Studies became the Center for Canadian Studies.
