         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p> The records of the <emph render="bold">Charles W. Hoyt Company</emph>
		  advertising agency span the years 1894-1973 with the bulk dating between
		  1909-1928. The collection primarily documents the founding and operation of the
		  company, and to a lesser extent the personal activities of the Hoyt family
		  (Charles, Effie, Winthrop, and Everett) and Winthrop's service during World War
		  II in the U. S. Army Air Force. Materials include correspondence, scrapbooks,
		  company publications and manuals, financial records, clippings, diaries,
		  writings, drawings, photographs, house advertisements, Nazi medals, song
		  lyrics, and printed material. Very little information exists in the collection
		  concerning the Hoyt Company's clients. The only client advertisements that
		  survive were produced for
		  Merck and Co. The Hoyt company scrapbooks document
		  some activities for clients including
		  Arnold Bakers,
		  Golden Blossom Honey,
		  Jamaica Tourist Board,
		  KLM,
		  Stanley Home Products, the
		  Charles B. Woolson Co. and the
		  State of New Hampshire. The collection contains
		  correspondence between family members as well as between the company and Merck
		  and Co., the
		  Charles B. Knox Co., and
		  William Benton, one of the founders of the Benton
		  and Bowles advertising agency. Another notable person mentioned in the
		  collection is Hoyt Company employee
		  Samuel Meek, who would go on to become an
		  important executive for the
		  J. Walter Thompson Company advertising agency. The
		  collection is organized into the <emph render="bold">Company Series</emph>; the
		  <emph render="bold">Family Series</emph>; and the <emph render="bold">Winthrop
		  Hoyt World War II Series</emph>. Large-format items are located in the
		  <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph>.</p>
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Company Series</emph> contains the bulk of
		  material in the collection and is concerned with the founding, and subsequent
		  operation of the Charles W. Hoyt Company from 1909 to 1965 by Charles W. Hoyt
		  (until his death in 1928), and then by his sons Winthrop and Everett
		  <emph render="doublequote">Red</emph> Hoyt. The Company produced and sold
		  advertising and marketing plans to clients in addition to providing other
		  advertising services. Charles Hoyt's philosophy of <emph render="doublequote">planned</emph> advertising is well-documented. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Family Series</emph> consists of personal
		  diaries, correspondence, photographs and other printed materials relating to
		  Hoyt family members as distinct from the activities of the Charles W. Hoyt
		  Company. Family members for whom materials exist include Charles W. Hoyt, Effie
		  Smith Hoyt, Winthrop Hoyt, and Everett <emph render="doublequote">Red</emph>
		  Hoyt.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Winthrop Hoyt World War II Records
		  Series</emph> documents Hoyt's service during the war as an intelligence
		  officer in the
		  United States Army Air Force. It includes
		  correspondence and writings, photographs, Nazi medals and other materials.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> include items removed
		  from other series due to their size.</p>

                  <p> Includes letters pertaining to Charles W. Hoyt's resignation

				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1909</unitdate>; others are between Winthrop Hoyt and William
				  Benton, one of the founders of the Benton and Bowles advertising agency. Their

				  proposal to Benton that he work for the Hoyt Company to assist in its
				  reorganization. (See also the <emph render="bold">D'Arcy Masius Benton and

                  <p> Contains scrapbooks compiled by the Hoyt Company which pertain
				  to company anniversary celebrations, company activities and clients, as well as
				  to the general state of advertising. Winthrop Hoyt's involvement and leadership

				  Scrapbook consists of printed material, programs, clippings, and other items
				  from the convention, held in London in 1924. The scrapbook has been dismantled
				  and foldered in its original chronological order. See the Photographs folders
				  for photographs removed from the scrapbook. The 30th, 40th, and 50th
				  Anniversary scrapbooks primarily consist of congratulatory correspondence, but
				  also include a few clippings and printed materials. See also
