         <p>The creator of this archive is unknown, although one could speculate that the author and illustrator was Mercedes Miller of Seattle, Washington. Two pieces of correspondence addressed to her, dating from 1947 and the 1950s, were found inlaid in one of the collection's sketchbooks. This is strictly a circumstantial speculation; there is no way to match the handwriting style of the erotica with Miller's handwriting, and none of the stories or illustrations are autographed or signed with any identifying information.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>This collection contains an archive of original illustrations, four sketchbooks, and erotic stories, depicting transgressive sex acts including (but not limited to) lesbian and heterosexual sex, incest, pedophilia, sadomassochistic behavior, and copulation with objects as varied as sex toys, produce, and household appliances. The stories and illustrations appear to be the work of a single individual, with nearly all narrative told from a female's point of view. Also includes some amateur pornographic photography and magazine clippings.</p>
         
         <p>The stories included in the collection range in length from one page to 46 pages. Two of the four sketchbooks include drafts of multiple storylines. Most stories are handwritten in the style of a graphic novel; some are typed. All include accompanying hand-drawn illustrations. There are also loose, miscellaneous illustrations in the collection with no correlating story. The collection's photographs and magazine clippings appear to have been used as models for some of the sketches and artwork. The photographs include at least one image of a hermaphroditic woman who appears in some of the accompanying stories.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
