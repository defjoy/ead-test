         <abstract>Greensboro, North Carolina developer and construction company executive;  originator of the concept and name for Research Triangle Park. The Romeo Guest Papers span the dates 1925-1987 with the bulk of the collection dated 1950-1986 and consists of correspondence, business records, clippings and printed material, and plans documenting the development of Research Triangle Park from conceptualization and groundbreaking through periods of growth and success in the 1970s and 1980s.  The collection is organized into series for Appointment Books, a Condensed File of key events, Chronological Files, Corporate Files, Manuscript Material, People, Pinelands Company Files, Printed Material, and Audiocassettes.  The Appointment Books Series houses Guest's annual schedules for the bulk of his professional life, consisting chiefly of notes on appointments but also containing ideas and thoughts as they occured to him.  The Condensed File Series contains files on important events in the development of the "Research Triangle" and individuals instrumental in the bringing that vision to fruition.  These people include Guest, business investor Karl Robbins, William Newell, Gordon Gray, and NC governor Luther Hodges.  More detailed files on events and people described in the Condensed File can be found in the Chronological Files Series.  These document the coordination efforts between the three major research universities in the area, private corporate interests, and the North Carolina state government.  The Corporate Files Series contains files related to Guest's construction company, C.M. Guest and Sons, including some files on Research Triangle projects as well as other construction works in North and South Carolina.  A series for Manuscript Material houses drafts and notes of Guest's unpublished history of the inception of Research Triangle Park.  The People Series houses additional files on people of interest to Guest, including some involved in the success of the Research Triangle as well as research work on Guest and the Research Triangle.  The Pinelands Company Files Series contains files documenting the work of the company created to acquire and develop land for Research Triangle Park.  A series of additional Printed Material includes newspaper clippings documenting the construction of Research Triangle and the success of companies there as well as publicity for the then-new Research Triangle.  The Audiocassettes Series, containing recorded oral histories and interviews with important figures associated with the development of the Research Triangle, completes the collection.</abstract>

         <p>The term "Research Triangle" was first used by builder Romeo H. Guest in 1954 while making notes for a meeting to win support for a research park in central North Carolina.  Hoping to take advantage of the southern migration of the industrial and manufacturing sectors from the Northeast, Guest and colleagues approached then Lt. Governor Luther Hodges about government support for the idea.  In 1955, Gov. Hodges worked build partnerships for a Research Triangle park, enlisting the support of the three major universities in the area, Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as support of government and business leaders.  To fund the project, Hodges secured the backing of real estate investor Karl Robbins.  1957, the Pinelands Company was created to buy land to create a contiguous parcel of 5,000 acres in Durham, and Wake Counties.  Despite waning support from Robbins, in 1959 ground was broken for the Research Triangle Institute, the first major research insitution in Research Triangle Park.  Chemstrand Corp. became the first corporation to develop space in Research Triangle Park soon after.  As of 2007, Research Triangle Park has expanded to almost 7,000 acres of total area encompassing 157 research and development facilities.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

               <p>Originally assembled by Guest to facilitate research access to his papers, the <emph render="bold">Condensed File Series</emph> provides an overview of the history of the Research Triangle Park from the 1950s to 1980. It contains biographies of Guest and other relevant people, general written histories, chronologies of key dates, and transcripts of oral histories by some of the key figures behind the Research Triangle's inception. It also houses an overview of the filing system employed by Guest in assembling his own personal papers. More detailed files can be found in the subseries organized by era that follow.</p>

               <p>By far the largest in the collection, this series is organized into eras following Guest's original designations: the <emph render="bold">Somnolence Era</emph>, <emph render="bold">Think Up/Start Up Era</emph>, <emph render="bold">Consolidation of Gains</emph>, <emph render="bold">Great Leap Forward</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Bright Future</emph>. Files generally contain a mix of correspondence, clippings, reports, and printed material. The <emph render="bold">Somnolence Era</emph> covers the period from 1925-1950, beginning with a treasurer's report from Guest's alma mater, MIT, and ending with files discussing the early impetus for the plan that became the Research Triangle.  The <emph render="bold">Think Up/Start Up Era</emph> comprises the bulk of the series and spans the period from 1951-1960. In addition to the files found in all era subseries, it also includes files on advertising, schools and institutions in the area, and other research parks in the United States. The <emph render="bold">Consolidation of Gains</emph> files cover the period from 1961 to 1970, while the <emph render="bold">Great Leap Forward</emph> group covers the period 1971-1980; the latter consists chiefly of correspondence and clippings, but also includes a draft history of the Research Triangle written by Guest. The <emph render="bold">Bright Future</emph> era subseries covers dates 1981-1986 and consists chiefly of newspaper clippings by Guest documenting the success of the Research Triangle and entitites within it as the center grew.  Some files also refer to the importance given by Guest to the Research Triangle project.  </p>
               
               <p>Material is organized alphabetically within each era; material has been sorted into eras according to the start date of each file.  Thus files spanning multiple eras can be found in the eariest era in the range.  Researchers are advised to check earlier era subseries in order to ensure access to all relevant material on later eras.  </p>

               <p>Contains oversize material separated from other series. The bulk consists of newspaper clippings from the Chronological Files and the Printed Material Series. In addition, a number of maps and plans of Raleigh, Durham, and the proposed Research Triangle Park dating from the 1950s through 1980 can be found here. Documents from the Pinelands Company Series include clippings related the Chemstrand Corporation, a sales prospect, and some property tax sheets. While most material relates to the Research Triangle in some way, a clipping book housing clippings dated 1955-1957 includes clippings about sailing competitions.  </p>
