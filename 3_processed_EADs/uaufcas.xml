		  Admissions and Financial Aid, Residential Life, Freshman
		  Year, Advanced Placement, Athletics and Recreation, Health

         <p>The Duke University Undergraduate Faculty Council
		  of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), established in 1971, guided
		  undergraduate education in arts and sciences, adopted
		  academic regulations and admissions policies, advised on
		  financial aid and recognized academic achievement. It
		  succeeded the Undergraduate Faculty Council after the body
		  no longer included representatives from the engineering and
		  nursing schools. Council membership consisted of the
		  president, provost, dean of the undergraduate college, and
		  elected members of the faculties of the humanities, natural
		  sciences, and social sciences. The dean presided at
		  meetings, while a member of the faculty was elected chair
		  of the Executive Committee. </p>
         
         <p>Most of Council's work was done through its
		  standing and ad hoc committees, which included: Curriculum,
		  Courses of Instruction, Honors, Study Abroad, Program II,
		  Academic Standards, Advising, Undergraduate Admissions and
		  Financial Aid, Residential Life, Freshman Year, Advanced
		  Placement, Athletics and Recreation, Health Science
		  Education, and Non-western Studies. In 1991, UFCAS voted to
		  disband and reorganize as the Arts and Sciences
		  Council.</p>
