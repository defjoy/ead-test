         <p>taken from International Association's homepage http://www.duke.edu/web/intlassoc/about_us.html</p>
         
         <p>The International Association spun off International Club, which was formed in the mid-1950s as an organization to provide social programming for graduate and undergraduate international students. Since the name change, the International Association has centered its goals on the integration of the international and American communities at Duke.</p>
         
         <p>The International Council was derived from the International Association in 1999, as international students became increasingly aware that a variety of their administrative needs, from holiday housing to liaisons between Duke's myriad cultural groups, were still sadly lacking.  The International Council then joined forces with DSG (Duke Student Government) to create an entity that would "act as an advisory board to DSG and as a lobbying organization representing international students in front of the administration."</p>
         
         <p>Beginning in fall 2001, the International Association and the International Council began to function as a conglomerate with the purpose of developing and promoting internationalism at Duke, inculcating the diverse cultures of international students in the Duke Community and spreading political and non-political awareness of issues affecting their daily lives. </p>
