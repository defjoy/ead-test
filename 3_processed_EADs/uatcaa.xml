         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The origin of the Trinity College (Durham, N.C.) Athletic Association is unclear.  It is likely that it was established soon after Trinity joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association during the 1902-1903 academic year, as did other similar institutions.  What is known is that in 1907, the Board of Trustees approved the formation of the Athletic Council, which served as the governing body of athletics on-campus.  Between the two, athletic events/games were organized. The Athletic Association is probably the predecessor to the current Dept. of Athletics.  </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection includes correspondence and contracts related to baseball and basketball games played by Trinity College teams from 1912-1918.  There is also a folder of correspondence regarding an 1888 football game.  The correspondence and contracts give insight into the business-end of college athletics regarding game schedules, location, and fees.  There are some Trinity-produced contracts with the heading "Trinity College Athletic Association" as well as contracts with the heading "Trinity College Athletic Council."  The collection dates from 1912-1937.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
