         <abstract>Lithography company founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, in about 1847. The Strobridge Lithographing Company Advertisements span the years 1910 through 1954, documenting much of the company's printed poster advertising work from that era. All images are black and white. The core of the collection, the Image Files Series, consists of around 1000 8x10 photographs ("A" images) of advertising designs, and a similar number of smaller printed cards (approx. 5x7 to 5x8, "B" images) of outdoor advertisement designs. The images are accompanied by three different Access Files to be used to browse the collection. These files are in the form of image photocopies ( "job tickets" ) and catalog cards. Most images are of poster (billboard or transit card) designs, but there are also some photographs of tabletop display advertising, window cards and other point-of-purchase displays. The collection documents advertising during a time when transportation was changing in America, and the automobile was gaining in popularity. Billboards began to replace smaller posters, accommodating a more mobile public. It was then that Strobridge turned from its emphasis on circus and theater posters (not represented in the collection) to billboard ads for mass-produced products. Many different products are featured, but perhaps the two most prominent and well-represented campaigns are those for Camel cigarettes and Palmolive soaps. The images form a valuable reference collection of advertising designs, relevant for researchers from a variety of disciplines including commercial artwork, advertising history and design, and popular culture.  The collection documents outdoor advertising design during the first part of the twentieth century for what were mostly national brands. Numerous examples are from the era of hand-drawn and painted designs, often signed by artists including Norman Rockwell, Howard Scott, and Dr. Seuss (see his designs for the product Flit). Rarely, an artist is listed on the back of the image. Later designs from the 1940s and 1950s include photographic images, often peppered with celebrity likenesses including John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, and Charlton Heston. Many of the celebrity advertisements promoted tobacco products. Some designs are clearly war-era, such as advertisements depicting a 1943 female factory worker, or one from Schlitz (1942) mentioning war bonds.</abstract>

            <p>The collection came to Duke in good order with all of the "A" images
			 (mostly 8x10 photographs of advertisements) together and all of the "B" images
			 (advertisements on 5x7 and 5x8 printed cards) together. The "job tickets,"
			 which are actually 
			 photocopies of all the images, have been
			 copied again onto acid-free paper. The original set is in numerical order. The
			 second set was put in order according to product type categories used by the
			 outdoor advertising industry. Thus, there are three access files to all images
			 in the collection: (1) 
			 photocopies in order by number, (2) 
			 photocopies in order by product type or
			 service (topic), and (3) a 
			 card file with descriptive information ordered
			 by the pictured advertisement's brand name. The card file does contain some
			 generic product-type headings also, e.g., gas ovens. It arrived with the
			 collection and appears to be incomplete.</p>
            
            <p>The Access Files (the photocopied job tickets and card file) and
			 Image Files (photographs and printed cards) all refer to an "A" and "B"
			 numbering system. Each file, however, does not have exactly the same number of
			 items, and so certain series may be missing some individual numbers. 
			 Photographic materials have been sleeved in
			 polypropylene.</p>
            
            <p>As of October 2002, the advertisements in this collection were not
			 indexed in the library's Resource for Outdoor Advertising Description (ROAD)
			 database.</p>

               <event>Hines Strobridge took over the company presidency (no longer
				listed as manager). Procter and Gamble's 
				<subject>Ivory Soap</subject> was advertised on an outdoor poster
				developed by the firm. ("[This] is noteworthy on several counts: first, because

				medium; second, because it is reputed to be the first time that a photograph

		  Strobridge Lithographing Company, especially
		  well-known for its production of circus and theatrical posters from the late
		  1800s and early 1900s, also produced a variety of printed items including maps,

		  through 1954. The firm was established in 
		  Cincinnati, but a New York address can also be

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Strobridge Lithographing Company
		  Advertisements</title> span the years 1910 through 1954, documenting much of
		the company's printed 
		poster advertising work from that era. All images are
		black and white. The core of the collection, the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Image Files Series</title>,
		consists of around 1000 
		8x10 photographs ("A" images) of 
		advertising designs, and a similar number of smaller 
		printed cards (approx. 5x7 to 5x8, "B" images) of 
		outdoor advertisement designs. The images are
		accompanied by three different 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Access Files</title> to be used to
		browse the collection. These files are in the form of image 
		photocopies (<emph render="doublequote">job
		tickets</emph>) and 
		catalog cards. Most images are of 
		poster (billboard or transit card) designs, but there
		are also some 
		photographs of 
		tabletop display advertising, 
		window cards and other 
		point-of-purchase displays. The collection documents
		advertising during a time when transportation was changing in America, and the
		automobile was gaining in popularity. 
		Billboards began to replace smaller 
		posters, accommodating a more mobile public. It was
		then that 
		Strobridge turned from its emphasis on circus and
		theater posters (not represented in the collection) to 
		billboard ads for mass-produced products. Many
		different products are featured, but perhaps the two most prominent and
		well-represented campaigns are those for 
		Camel cigarettes and 
		Palmolive soaps. The images form a valuable reference
		collection of 
		advertising designs, relevant for researchers from a
		variety of disciplines including 
		commercial artwork,
            advertising history and design, and 
		popular culture.
         </p>
         
         <p> The collection documents 
		  outdoor advertising design during the first part of
		  the twentieth century for what were mostly national brands. Numerous examples
		  are from the era of hand-drawn and painted designs, often signed by artists
		  including 
		  Norman Rockwell,
            Howard Scott, and 
		  Dr. Seuss (see his designs for the product Flit).
		  Rarely, an artist is listed on the back of the image. Later designs from the
		  1940s and 1950s include 
		  photographic images, often peppered with
		  celebrity likenesses including John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, and Charlton Heston.
		  Many of the celebrity advertisements promoted 
		  tobacco products. Some designs are clearly war-era,
		  such as advertisements depicting a 1943 female factory worker, or one from
		  Schlitz (1942) mentioning war bonds. </p>
         
         <p>The first series, the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Access Files,</title> can be used
		to browse the collection and narrow a search for an individual advertisement
		before moving on to the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Image Files</title> themselves.
		Items in the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Image Files</title> are labeled
		with an "A" or a "B" indication. The "A" group holds the larger 
		8x10 photographs and the "B" group contains
		smaller images (primarily 5x7 and 5x8) printed on cards. There is some
		duplication between the "A" and "B" groups. The "A" images contain
		advertisements from the 1910s through the 1950s, and the "B" advertisements
		were created mainly in the 1920s and 1930s. All 
		point-of-purchase advertising is in the "A" group.
		There is often indication of the size poster the design was made into (e.g.
		24-sheet), a design or perhaps job number (e.g. Camel No. 93), and a title
		(e.g. 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Perfect</title> for a Camel
		advertisement with the text "Perfect Taste"). Most designs are presumed to have
		been created and published by 
		Strobridge, but there are some images stamped "W. J.
		Rankin Corp." Some images show billboards as they were posted; some of these
		show the nameplate of the outdoor advertising company that owned the billboard
		structures.</p>
         
         <p> The name of the collection is seen on folders and sometimes elsewhere
		  as the 
		  "Strobridge Lithography Company," but the
		  materials themselves as well as other documentation reveal the name to be 
		  "Strobridge Lithographing Company" at the time
		  when most of this collection was created. Almost all advertisements are in
		  English, presumably for posting in the U.S., but a few, such as Spur cigarette
		  advertisements, are in Spanish.</p>
         
         <p>Related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library include a number of other outdoor advertising collections,
		  such as the Outdoor Advertising Slide Library, the John Paver Papers, the John
		  Browning Papers, the Duplex Advertising Co. Records, the H.E. Fisk Collection
		  of War Effort Mobilization Campaigns, the Outdoor Advertising Association of
		  America Records, the Outdoor Advertising Poster Design Collection, the Garrett
		  Orr Papers, the R.C. Maxwell Company Records, the Howard Scott Papers, and the
		  John E. Brennan Outdoor Advertising Survey Reports. There are also numerous
		  published items from the era of this collection which provide even more context
		  for the designs.</p>

				in searching for individual advertisements within the 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Image Files.</title> The first
			 two 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Access Files</title> subseries
			 are 
			 photocopies (called here "job tickets") of all
			 the images in the 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="bold">Image Files</title> arranged
			 in two different ways. The first group of job tickets is arranged as the images
			 are, in number order. The second subseries is an exact copy of the first, but
			 arranged by advertising topic, described below. Each file, however, does not
			 have exactly the same number of items, and so certain series may be missing
			 some individual numbers. The third subseries is the 
			 card file, comprised of cards with brief
			 description and indexed terms from the advertisements. The images contain
			 additional information recorded on the verso side.</p>

                     <p>This category includes advertising created for charitable
					 causes such as Christmas Seals or by non-profit organizations. Government
					 organizations are listed under Business and Technology, but government
					 sponsorship of an advertisement was often difficult to discern. Check this
					 category and Business and Technology for a comprehensive search of
					 government-sponsored or government-related advertisements. Political issue
					 advertisements may be found here and include presumably World War II era
					 cartoons of the 
					 "Axis Ape." Some Public Service-type
					 advertisements were placed under the sponsor's usual category, if the sponsor's
					 name was an obvious part of the advertisement. For instance an advertisement
					 saying "Buy War Bonds... courtesy of Coca-Cola Products" may have been placed
					 under Beverages. At least one advertisement in this category is signed by
					 Norman Rockwell. Themes include Christmas as well as World War I and World War
					 II troop support. Organizations represented include the Cincinnati War Chest,
					 Red Cross, a state fair, and churches.</p>
