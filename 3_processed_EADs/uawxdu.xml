            <p>WXDU, a non-profit student run radio station, was founded in 1983 when former station WDUK-1600AM switched to a FM signal.  Whereas WDUK broadcasts were limited by the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) to a range that barely covered the Duke University campus the new FM station WXDU could broadcast throughout the entire Durham community as well as the Duke University campus.  The mission statement of WXDU proclaims that, as a member of the Duke University Union, [it] exists to inform, educate, and entertain both the students of Duke University and the surrounding community of Durham through quality progressive alternative radio programming.</p>
