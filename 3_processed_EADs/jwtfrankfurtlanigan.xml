         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Denis Lanigan, former advertising executive of the J.
		  Walter Thompson Company, span the years 1958 to 1964, with the bulk of the
		  material dating from 1959 to 1960 and from 1963 to 1964. The papers primarily
		  document activities of JWT's Frankfurt Office during the years Lanigan served
		  as Joint Manager. Specific topics covered are efforts to increase and improve
		  the use of television and print advertising in Europe, especially England and
		  Germany; to improve coordination of international JWT Offices to better serve
		  client interests; to increase European business; and to handle a variety of
		  personnel, public relations, and marketing concerns. The papers consist of
		  typed and handwritten correspondence, telexes and telegrams, memoranda, notes,
		  reports, one photograph, press releases, speeches, contracts, newsletters,
		  clippings, product samples, collateral literature and advertisements. Clients
		  of the company represented in the collection include Chesebrough-Pond's,
		  Findus, Ford, Johnson Wax (or Johnson-Gruenol), Kaufhof, Kraft, Lever-Sunlicht,
		  Pan American Airways, Pepsi, Rowntree, Singer, Triumph, Warner-Lambert, Wick,
		  and others. Correspondents include clients; executives from JWT offices such as
		  George Black, David Campbell-Harris, Bill Hinks, Constance B. Ivie, Don
		  Johnston, Jens von Leutzendorff, Sam Meek, D. M. Saunders, Lubertus Smilde,
		  Norman Strouse, Thomas Sutton, and Edward G. Wilson; media consultants such as
		  Eric Boden; and persons affiliated with various companies and organizations.
		  </p>
         
         <p>Approximately 70 percent of the collection is in English and the
		  remainder is in German, with the exception of very small amounts of French,
		  Italian, and Dutch. English is the sole language of the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="arti"> Articles Series</ref> and the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="layt">Layton Awards Series</ref>, and
		  the predominant language in the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr"> Correspondence Series</ref>, the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="othe">Other JWT Offices Series</ref>,
		  and the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="meet"> Meetings Series</ref>. English
		  and German are used in roughly equal amounts in the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="clie"> Clients Series</ref>, the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="new">New Business Series</ref> and the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="mark"> Marketing and Research/Abteilung
			 Marktforschung Series</ref>. German is the predominant language in the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="memo"> Memoranda/Haus-Mitteilungen
			 Series</ref>.</p>
         
         <p>The 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr">Correspondence Series</ref>
		  documents Lanigan's transition from JWT's New York Office to the Frankfurt
		  office, coordination between the Frankfurt and London Offices, Frankfurt's
		  day-to-day operations, German and American attitudes toward advertising, and
		  reviews of a German-made film on U.S. advertising called 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote"> Bilder aus der neuen
		  Welt</title> ( 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Pictures from the New
		  World).</title> The film profiles JWT, Benson and Mather, Dr. Dichter, Ogilvy,
		and McCann-Erickson advertising agencies. The series also contains information
		on accounts, including market strategies, difficulties in dealing with the
		European management of Playtex, the coordination of Unilever, acquisition of
		the Pan Am account in Vienna, and the production of television ads for various
		clients. Correspondents from the New York office include Paul Albright, George
		Black, Aldis Butler, M. Lee Calvert, Robert Carman, Malcolm Davis, Peter
		Dunham, Robert Hawes, William Hinks, Connie Ivie, Sam Meek, O'Neill Ryan,
		Norman Strouse, Clifford Snyder, and Lubertus Smilde, and from the London
		office Thomas G. Hardie and D.M. Saunders. Other correspondents in this series
		include persons affiliated with various media consulting firms; economic
		research organizations; the advertising agencies Troost and McCann-Erickson;
		and Booz, Allen, and Hamilton International; and organizations such as
		Advertiser's Weekly, the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, and the

         <p>The 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="othe">Other J. Walter Thompson Offices
			 Series</ref> consists of correspondence between Denis Lanigan and executives
		  from JWT's international offices. Files for the London and New York Offices
		  contain the most material, while Amsterdam, Milan, and Paris are also
		  substantial among the thirty-five offices documented. Topics include aspects of
		  film production for clients, the impact of legislation and public perception on
		  advertising internationally, training and personnel matters, Frankfurt Office
		  visitors, and international public relations for JWT. Some issues that are
		  covered specifically include 1962 total advertising expenditures in the UK;
		  Lord Robens' speech on advertising and politics; a major German exhibit on
		  advertising and the consumer (“Der umworbene Mensch”); information on outdoor
		  advertising in Italy; market research on the German beer and bread markets; the
		  need for establishing a JWT Office in Vienna; the development, testing and
		  introduction of new Lever products in Germany such as CD and SIGNAL; efforts to
		  improve the overall quality of film advertising in Germany including the
		  unsuccessful attempt to recruit well-known theater director Peter Zadek; and an
		  evaluation of the need for better assessing client conflicts of interest,
		  arising in part from the conflict between Canada Mink and the Swedish SAGA Mink
		  as JWT clients in Europe. Correspondents from the London Office include James
		  Archibald, Jeremy Bullmore, Christopher Cross, Bill Hinks, Norman Basset, Carl
		  Ivens, Elizabeth Oxley, Michael Patmore, Douglas Saunders, and Tom Sutton; and
		  from the New York Office, Gordon Conley and Edward Wilson among others. Current

         <p>The original organization of the material has been retained in large
		  part. The only change that was made was to break up the strictly chronological
		  arrangement of all records by business year so that the individual series could
		  be brought together and would cover the entire range of years for which records
		  exist. Only duplicate items have been removed. The client names have also been
		  retained according to the filing system of the Frankfurt Office. Although
		  Lever-Sunlicht is a 100% subsidiary of Unilever, JWT-Frankfurt's correspondence
		  with this client is filed under the letter "L" and not "U." Similarly Eastman
		  Kodak Company is referred to in correspondence as "Kodak," and files under "K."
		  Advertisements have been photocopied, and originals have been transferred to
		  the Frankfurt Advertisement Collection. Newsletters from JWT offices other than
		  Frankfurt have been transferred to the J. Walter Thompson Company Archives
		  Newsletter Collection.</p>
