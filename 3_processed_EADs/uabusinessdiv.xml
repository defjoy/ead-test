         <p>The Business Division of Duke University
		  coordinated the financial and administrative business of
		  schools and departments throughout Duke University. </p>
         
         <p>During World War II, the Business Division
		  mediated requests for student records and information
		  pertaining to students enrolling (or deferring enrollment)
		  in the Selective Service. The Business Division was also
		  associated with some construction and building improvements
		  on campus, particularly those of the Arts Center and East
		  Campus buildings. The Business Division maintained
		  contracts for these and other projects during the
		  1960s.</p>
         
         <p>A. S. (Alfred Smith) Brower was a longtime staff
		  member of the Business Division. Before coming to Duke
		  University, Brower held several state government posts in
		  finance and statistics, and was the Comptroller at North
		  Carolina State University. From 1939 to 1946, Brower was
		  administrative assistant in the Business Division. He then
		  became the business manager and comptroller (now
		  treasurer), serving in that position from 1946 until 1956.
		  From 1956 to 1959, he served as the Business Division's
		  business manager and treasurer. Brower died in 1968 at age
		  76. </p>
         
         <p>In 1962, the Business Division was reorganized and
		  renamed. The newly-formed Business and Finance Division was
		  headed by the Vice President for Business and Finance, who
		  was the chief fiscal officer of the university and reported
		  to the president. </p>
