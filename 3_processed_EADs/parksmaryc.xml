         <abstract>Journals (1827-July-1832 Jan. 20) in the form of diary entries and extracts from letters, written principally while the author was travelling with family and friends in France, Switzerland, and Germany between July and October, 1827. The bulk of the entries are written from Paris and include an account of a meeting with a group of Osage Indians that were visiting there. Other entries describe the local landscape, history, folklore, and customs of the various places visited. There are numerous color and pencil drawings that illustrate the text. Also includes one letter (1878 Oct. 10) and a clipping. </abstract>
