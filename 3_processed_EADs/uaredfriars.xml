         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Order of Red Friars was a secret men's
		  honorary founded in 1913 by members of the senior class at
		  Trinity College (now Duke University). The Red Friars'
		  mission was to promote social spirit at Trinity College;
		  later groups declared their purpose was to foster loyalty
		  and interest in the university through anonymous service in
		  student organizations. Officers consisted of Grand Friar
		  (President), Worthy Friar (Vice President), Grand Recorder
		  (of minutes), Grand Treasurer (Treasurer), Grand
		  Communicator (conducted correspondence), Grand Keeper of
		  the Gate (guarded door at meetings), and Grand Herald
		  (notified members of meetings). </p>
         
         <p>Each year's group consisted of seven men, the
		  Septemvirate, chosen by the previous year's leaders, based
		  on their character, scholarship, qualities and potential of
		  leadership, and outstanding service to the university.
		  Tapping ceremonies were held in late spring, and grew more
		  elaborate over the years. In its final and most traditional
		  form, a red hooded figure publicly tapped new men to
		  membership on the steps of Duke Chapel. This ceremony, the
		  wearing of red carnations once a month, and the ringing of
		  "Charley" the Friars' bell, were the only public notices
		  given to the organization. All activities and projects were
		  kept secret. Two projects conducted completely by Friars
		  were the creation of the plaque of Duke University's aims
		  and the plans for the construction on West Campus of a Red
		  Friars' monastery. </p>
         
         <p>Members of Red Friars held leadership positions in
		  Omicron Delta Kappa, Young Men's Christian Association,
		  Inter-Fraternity Council, the Judicial Board, Freshman
		  Advisory Council, Men's Student Government Association,
		  Associated Student Government of Duke University, class
		  offices, athletics, the Chanticleer, the Chronicle, the
		  Men's Glee Club, and fraternities. Members had been
		  involved in student government and social activities since
		  their arrival on campus, and by their senior year, became
		  part of this special group of leaders on campus. </p>
         
         <p>Achievements of Red Friars were aimed at
		  improvement of student life and the development of loyalty
		  to the university. Because the Friars were also leaders of
		  student government and social life, many ideas conceived in
		  Friars' secret meetings later were brought to life without
		  the campus being aware of their origins. Other schemes not
		  conceived of by Friars were successful because of the
		  motivation of support by Friars in their various positions
		  of campus leadership. Examples of both are the Wartime
		  Student Activities Board, Joe College Weekends,
		  reorganization of fraternity and rush rules, agitation for
		  change in the housing system, course and professor
		  evaluations, elimination of Duke and Duchess, improvement
		  of student-faculty relationships, and pep rally planning.
		  </p>
         
         <p>The Friars were very important to the President
		  and Deans of the university both as a means of discovering
		  and influencing student opinion; they were often were privy
		  to information that was not widely known on campus. These
		  relationships were reinforced by the fact that many
		  faculty, administrators, and Board of Trustees members were
		  Friars or had been given an honorary membership. The Friars
		  had up to three honorary members at any given time,
		  composed of upper level administration and faculty members.
		  Honorary members included William Preston Few, William H.
		  Wannamaker, Robert L. Flowers, James Cannon, George Allen,
		  Herbert Herring, James Truesdale, Coach Wallace Wade,
		  Everett Weatherspoon, Alan Manchester, Furman McLarty, Ted
		  Minah, Arthur Hollis Edens, William Griffith, Thomas
		  Southgate, Marshall Pickens, and Raymond Nasher. The Friars
		  held meetings with members of the faculty and
		  administration to discuss campus situations and plans for
		  action. Opinions of both university and student leaders on
		  issues such as wartime regulations, integration, drinking
		  rules, fraternity regulation, housing problems, and the
		  honor system are contained within these discussions. </p>
         
         <p>The Friars suspended its activities during World
		  War II due to constant fluctuation in the student body that
		  made it difficult to choose students who would be in
		  attendance for a full school year. Friars' activities were
		  suspended at the close of the 1942-1943 school year and an
		  alumni committee formed to reestablish the order post-war.
		  The Friars were restored with the graduating class of 1949.
		  </p>
         
         <p>Red Friars voluntarily disbanded in 1971, after
		  failing to tap new members in 1970. Throughout the 1960s,
		  the order increasingly faced charges of elitism and had
		  difficulty selecting members who would accept membership.
		  In 1971, after a meeting of Friar alumni, the order was
		  discontinued as it was considered to have outlived its
		  usefulness for the university and the student body. </p>
         
         <p>Although the order has never been reestablished at
		  Duke University, Order of Red Friars alumni continue to
		  provide exceptional leadership and support of Duke
		  University endeavors.</p>
