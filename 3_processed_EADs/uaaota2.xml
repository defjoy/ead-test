         <p>All of the Above (AOTA) is an annual theatrical production comprised of monologues written, performed by, and directed by Duke women about Duke life. AOTA's goal is to present a collection of women's voices that will spark honest dialogue about serious issues, such as rape, eating disorders, success, and relationships. AOTA was developed and executed by senior Mary Adkins in 2003 as a response to the 2003 Women's Initiative commissioned by then President Nannerl O. Keohane. The first production took place in April 2004.</p>
