         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Completed and occupied in the spring of 1927, Bassett Hall was first known as Dormitory No. 4.  Like the other dormitories in the East Campus Georgian quadrangle, Dormitory No. 4 was designed to accommodate approximately 110 people and originally contained fifty single rooms, thirty double rooms, three parlors, a suite for the head of the house, kitchenette, pressing room, reception room, and offices.  In 1930, it was renamed in honor of John Spencer Bassett, a professor of history at Trinity College (now Duke University).</p>
            
            <p>
Bassett Residence Hall was home to female undergraduate students from the 1930s through the early 1990s. The Omicron chapter of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority lived in Bassett Residence Hall from 1930-1935. Over the years, general direction for residential living groups came from Duke University, Trinity College and the Woman's College. </p>
            
            <p>
The women of Bassett Residence Hall also relied on the guidance and rules of the Women's Student Government Association, the Women's Residence Council, the Freshman Advisory Council, and the Baldwin Federation. The Baldwin Federation was established in 1974 to represent interests of undergraduate residents of Alspaugh, Basset, Brown, and Pegram Houses. As of 2006, Bassett Residence Hall remains co-ed and non-selective.
