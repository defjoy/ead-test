         <abstract>The
		  Arts and Sciences Council was established at Duke
		  University in July 1991, when the Undergraduate Faculty
		  Council of Arts and Sciences disbanded and reconstituted
		  itself to include some aspects of graduate studies and
		  research initiatives. The Arts and Sciences Council is
		  elected by the Arts and Sciences faculty and serves as this
		  faculty's primary institution for faculty governance. The
		  Council also determines and implements the broad objectives
		  of undergraduate education and considers all matters
		  affecting the academic and residential environments of
		  students, making recommendations and adopting regulations
		  where appropriate. Records include correspondence, reports,
		  minutes, memoranda, questionnaires, and other materials
		  documenting the activities of the A &amp; S Council. The
		  bulk of the materials were generated by the Curriculum
		  Review Committee, circa 1992-1999. The collection also
		  features records created by several other committees,
		  including Academic Affairs, Academic Standards, Financial
		  Aid, Residential Life, and Senior Year.

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Arts and Sciences Council (A &amp; S Council)
		  was established 1 July 1991, when the Undergraduate Faculty
		  Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS) disbanded and
		  reconstituted itself; the Arts and Sciences Council first
		  met on September 12, 1991. Its purposes include
		  representing the faculty and advising the deans of Arts and
		  Sciences with particular respect to Trinity College. The A
		  &amp; S Council retained UFCAS's functions, but added other
		  matters to its purview, including some aspects of graduate
		  studies and research initiatives. The Executive Committee
		  of the Arts and Sciences Council established four ad hoc
		  committees and recommended to Deans White and Gillis
		  appointments to the following committees: Committee on
		  Facilities, Committee to Review Study Abroad, Curriculum
		  Review Committee, and the Committee on the Teaching of
		  Korean Languages. Since 1991, some of these committees have
		  been disbanded or re-organized, and new committees have
		  been formed.</p>
         
         <p>In 2005, the Arts and Sciences council provided
		  the following description of its purpose on its website:
		  "The Arts and Sciences Council is elected by the Arts and
		  Sciences faculty and serves as this faculty's primary
		  institution for faculty governance. The purposes of the
		  Council are to represent the faculty and advise the Deans
		  of Arts and Sciences and Trinity College with respect to:
		  Arts and Sciences priorities; faculty development; support
		  and policy for faculty research, teaching, and
		  administrative facilities; organization of departments and
		  units within the Arts and Sciences faculty; areas of
		  interaction between graduate and undergraduate programs
		  such as teaching assistantships, instructional budgets, and
		  teacher training; and any other matters of particular
		  concern to the Arts and Sciences faculty. With particular
		  respect to Trinity College, the Council determines and
		  implements the broad objectives of undergraduate education
		  and considers all matters affecting the academic and
		  residential environments of students, making
		  recommendations and adopting regulations where appropriate.
		  The Council meets monthly during the academic year."</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Arts and Sciences Council records include
		  correspondence, reports, minutes, memoranda,
		  questionnaires, and other materials documenting the
		  activities of the A&amp;S Council. The bulk of the
		  materials were generated by the Curriculum Review
		  Committee, circa 1992-1999. In 1992 Dean Richard White
		  appointed the Curriculum Review Committee to evaluate the
		  undergraduate curriculum. The records of the committee
		  document its processes of studying the curriculum as well
		  as its evaluation and recommendations. Surveys concerning
		  the curriculum, which were completed by faculty as well as
		  juniors and seniors are included. Curriculum issues
		  reflected in the records include the Undergraduate Writing
		  Course, requirements for academic majors, the division of
		  the curriculum into six areas of knowledge, and academic
		  advising. Copies of earlier curriculum studies,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Structure and Choice in
		  Liberal Education</title> (1986) and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">A Climate for Liberal
		  Learning</title> (1980), are included. </p>
         
         <p>The collection also features records created by
		  several other committees, including Academic Affairs,
		  Academic Standards, Financial Aid, Residential Life, and
		  Senior Year. </p>
