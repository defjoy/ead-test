         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Duke University Residential Program Review
		  began in 1998 when Judith White, a former Special Assistant
		  to the President, was appointed to direct the group. The
		  Residential Program Review has focused on improving
		  residential life on the West Campus for Duke's upperclass
		  students. Their most important accomplishment was
		  overseeing the completion of a new dormitory, the
		  West-Edens Link, in 2002. The building offers housing,
		  meeting and study rooms, and dining facilities. The
		  Residential Program Review continues to work on improving
		  other West Campus dormitories.</p>
         
         <p>On the Residential Program Review website,
		  &lt;www.duke.edu/web/rdr&gt;, the organization describes
		  its mission as follows:</p>
         
         <p>1. Provide residential space on Duke's historic
		  West campus which is sufficient in amount and which has
		  been maintained and upgraded in keeping with standards for
		  comfortable, safe living quarters. </p>
         
         <p>2. Create a climate for upperclass residential
		  life consistent with the principles that have been
		  articulated in all of our residential plans since 1994.
		  Those principles are: </p>
         
         <p>- support for intellectual and personal growth of
		  our undergraduates; </p>
         
         <p>- equity of access and variety of experiences in
		  the residential program; </p>
         
         <p>- building one diverse university community; and
		  </p>
         
         <p>- respect for Duke traditions of continuity and
		  change, achieved by honoring past generations of students
		  and faculty while preparing to serve students of the
		  future. </p>
