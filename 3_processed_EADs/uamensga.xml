         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Men's Student Government Association (MSGA) evolved from student councils in the early 1930s at Duke University's Trinity College. In April 1945, the Engineer's Student Government Association merged with the Trinity College Student Government Association to form the Men's Student Government Association. The MSGA created policies governing students, reviewed student group charters, and represented student interests to faculty and administration.</p>
         
         <p>
The Men's Student Government Association debated over the administration of the Duke University traditions test to freshmen (and required freshmen caps called dinks), the organization of the Committee on Freshmen Rules and Traditions, and measures taken when students failed the traditions exam. Meetings from the 1940s through the late 1960s included discussions about parking registration, aid for Hungarian students, alcohol use on campus, the issue of segregated seating in Wallace Wade Stadium, integration, and disciplinary actions. Meetings of the 1960s especially reflected student involvement in social issues like the Vietnam War, segregation in the Wallace Wade Stadium, and co-educational housing.</p>
         
         <p>
The Student-Faculty Advisory Committee (SFAC), a subcommittee of the MSGA, was composed of presidents of student groups, faculty, and administration. Meetings of the elite SFAC were closed to non-SFAC members, much to the protest of other students. Issues discussed at SFAC meetings significantly impacted policies at Duke University. The committee focused on regulation of illegal drugs, campus political organizations, campus traditions, cheating, the coordinate college system, and the Pickets and Protests Policy. The SFAC was most likely associated with the Order of Red Friars, a secret society of administrators, faculty, and students at Duke University. </p>
         
         <p>
The MSGA was supplanted by the Associated Students of Duke University in 1968. In 1993, the Associated Students of Duke University became known as Student Government Association.

Ordered by date.
