         <p>The Workers League for a Revolutionary Party, originally the Leninist League of the United States, was founded by George Spiro in 1938.  Spiro, known as George Marlin (a portmanteau of Marx and Lenin), formed the party after an ideological conflict with the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL), formed by Hugo Oehler as a Trotskyist movement within the Workers Party of the United States.  The conflict arose after RWL's rejection of Trotskyism.  Spiro and his followers, known as Marlenites, felt that the Leninsit League did not go far enough in vocalizing its rejection of Trotskyism and Trotsky himself.  The party published a newspaper, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">In Defense of Bolshevism.</title>  Interpreteing the Second World War as a war on the proletariat, the party became critical of both Leninism and Marxism, and in 1946, changed its name to the Workers League for a Revlutionary Party.  Amidst internal dissent, the party dissolved around 1950.</p>
