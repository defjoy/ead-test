         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of Tibor Scitovsky, Hungarian-born economist, date from
		  1910-2002, with the majority of the materials dating from the 1970s through
		  2002, and are composed of three major series: Correspondence, Financial and
		  Personal Materials Series; Writings and Speeches; and Printed Materials.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Financial and Personal
		  Materials Series</emph> consists primarily of routine professional
		  correspondence to Scitovsky from academic institutions, publishers, colleagues,
		  and friends. Many concern publications or invitations to events. There are a
		  number of brief but interesting exchanges with other economists, including 
		  Moses Abramovitz of Stanford, 
		  Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard, 
		  Paul Samuelson of MIT, 
		  Stanley K. Sheinbaum of Stanford, and 
		  Robert Solow, also at MIT.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</emph> highlights
		  materials on selected writings and themes that Scitovsky worked on in later
		  years, from the 1980s to 2002, and includes clippings, drafts, articles, and
		  numerous notes. Major academic works represented in this series include 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Joyless Economy</title> and articles on 
		market economies, 
		inflation, 
		growth and stagnation, 
		consumer satisfaction (and dissatisfaction), 
		marketing, 
		affluence, and 
		violence and 
		boredom as social ills. Many of his other major works
		and earlier research are not represented by these research materials. A series
		of photographs of Scitovky's family and home serve as companions to his
		unpublished 
		memoirs, which detail life in northern 
		Hungary for a family of nobility, as well as
		historical events in 
		Hungary, 
		France, and 
		England, particularly before and during World War
		II. The memoirs also offer a detailed narrative of Scivovsky's emigration from
		Hungary to the United States in the 1940s, as well as an account of the student
		protests in Paris in the 1960s.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> contains many
		  of Scitovsky's reprinted articles and may prove to be the most useful series

                  <p>Consists primarily of routine professional correspondence to
				  Scitovsky from academic institutions, publishers, colleagues, and friends. Many
				  concern publications or invitations to events. There are several brief but
				  interesting exchanges with other economists, including 
				  Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard, 
				  Moses Abramovitzof Stanford, 
				  Stanley Sheinbaum of Stanford, 
				  Robert Solow and 
				  Paul Samuelson of MIT, 
				  Louise Keely of Oxford, and 
				  H. W. Arndt, a specialist in 
				  economic development in the Pacific region;
				  topics range from publications, economics issues, to wartime history and
				  political events in the United States and Europe. There are also several short
				  memoirs on life in New York City in the 1930s, and essays on 
				  financial capitalism, written and collected by
				  Sheinbaum. Only in a handful of cases are
				  the letters from Scitovsky himself. Included in this series is a set of undated
				  correspondence on 
				  boredom, one of his later research topics, but
				  other than that, his writings and research topics are rarely referenced in the
				  correspondence; this information is best documented in the printed materials.
				  Arranged in chronological order by year.</p>

				satisfaction; the 
				United States economy and social conditions;
				market economies; the problems of affluence; growth and stagnation; and
				inflation. Another grouping contains notes, drafts, and photographs that
				contributed to his memoirs, published in part under the title

               <p>Houses a selection of reprints of Scitovsky's articles. In the
				  early years, his research focused on economic theory, international finance and
				  monopoly and competition. He progressed to prices under monopoly and
				  competition, the theory of balance of payments adjustment, and economic
				  welfare. Later writings analyzed growth in an affluent society, the U.S.
				  savings rate, the welfare of nations, and the benefits of asymmetric markets.
				  In the years before his death, Scitovsky's focus shifted to violence, and in
				  particular, boredom as the cause of violence. He referred to boredom as an
				  "overlooked disease." Arranged in chronological order by year.</p>
