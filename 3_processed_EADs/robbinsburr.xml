         <abstract> Burr Lamberton Robbins
		  was president of the General Outdoor Advertising Company (GOA).  The Burr L. Robbins Papers span the years
		  1936-1975, and chiefly consist of three scrapbooks containing photographs,
		  clippings, periodicals, memorabilia, and promotional materials. The majority of
		  clippings are from advertising industry publications and Chicago newspapers.
		  The loose materials section also includes administrative records. The
		  collection primarily documents Robbins' career in outdoor advertising with the
		  General Outdoor Advertising Company (GOA), and his involvement with
		  professional advertising organizations, particularly the Outdoor Advertising
		  Association of America (OAAA). Professional and outdoor advertising themes in
		  the scrapbooks include Robbins' career advancement; his public speaking
		  engagements on the role of advertising agencies in America; professional
		  meetings and conferences; the history of GOA; outdoor advertising history;
		  tension between citizens' groups and outdoor advertisers over billboard zoning;
		  and legal decisions. The scrapbooks also touch on topics of personal interest
		  to Robbins, including news about the Delevan Lake Improvement Association;
		  Robbinswood Farm sheep; and family events. Photographs in the scrapbooks are
		  primarily of professional meetings or conferences, or publicity events. Loose
		  materials include items that were once part of the scrapbooks, and separate
		  items. This section includes a notebook of 1942 photographs and papers about
		  the 13th National Contest and Exhibit of Outdoor Advertising Art. Photographs
		  of the three prizewinning posters, created by John DeLooy, Andrew Loomis, and
		  Albert Staehle, are included in this notebook. Also in this section is a
		  spiral-bound GOA publication,
		  Image with Words, that documents a
		  1963 Chevrolet electric outdoor advertising campaign.</abstract>

         <p>
            The Burr L. Robbins Papers span the years
		  1936-1975, and chiefly consist of three
		  scrapbooks containing
		  photographs,
		  clippings,
		  periodicals,
		  memorabilia, and
		  promotional materials. The majority of clippings
		  are from advertising industry publications and
		  Chicago newspapers. The loose materials section
		  also includes
		  administrative records. The collection primarily
		  documents Robbins' career in outdoor advertising with the
		  General Outdoor Advertising Company (GOA), and his
		  involvement with professional advertising organizations, particularly the
		  Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA).
		  Professional and
		  outdoor advertising themes in the scrapbooks include
		  Robbins' career advancement; his public speaking engagements on the role of
		  advertising agencies in America; professional
		  meetings and conferences; the history of
		  GOA; outdoor
		  advertising history; tension between citizens'
		  groups and outdoor advertisers over billboard zoning; and legal decisions. The
		  scrapbooks also touch on topics of personal interest to Robbins, including news
		  about the
		  Delevan Lake Improvement Association;
		  Robbinswood Farm sheep; and family events.
		  Photographs in the scrapbooks are primarily of professional meetings or
		  conferences;
		  advertising executives; or publicity events. Loose
		  materials include items that were once part of the scrapbooks, and separate
		  items. This section includes a notebook of 1942 photographs and papers about
		  the 13th
		  National Contest and Exhibit of Outdoor Advertising
			 Art. Photographs of the three prizewinning posters, created by John
		  DeLooy, Andrew Loomis, and Albert Staehle, are included in this notebook. Also
		  in this section is a spiral-bound GOA publication,

               <p>Consists of scrapbooks and loose materials. Scrapbooks contain
				photographs, magazine and newspaper clippings, periodicals, memorabilia, and
				promotional materials. The scrapbooks chiefly document Robbins' professional
				life and the history of the General Outdoor Advertising Company (GOA), but also
				include items relating to Robbins' personal life. Loose materials include
				scrapbook items that had been removed or had fallen out, and other materials.
				Includes a notebook of 1942 photographs and papers about the 13th National
				Contest and Exhibit of Outdoor Advertising Art. Also contained in this section
				is a spiral-bound GOA publication, "Image with Words," that was created to
				document a 1963 Chevrolet electric outdoor advertising campaign. Scrapbooks are
				arranged in original page order. No order could be determined for loose
				materials.</p>
               
               <p>Note: This series contains pictorial materials, newsprint, and
				other fragile materials. Please handle with care. Technical Services staff may
				need to reformat newsprint or other brittle paper.</p>
