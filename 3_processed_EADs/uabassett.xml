         <abstract>
		  John Spencer Bassett, a professor in the History Department
		  of Trinity College from 1893-1906, was a renowned educator
		  and advocate of freedom of expression. A native of North
		  Carolina, Bassett received his A.B. from Trinity College in
		  1888 and his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1894.
		  He returned to Trinity College to teach and was active in
		  teaching, writing and collecting southern Americana.
		  Bassett began publication of an annual series of
		  Historical Papers of
		  the Trinity College Historical Society; founded the
		  honorary society 9019, a precursor to Phi Beta Kappa;
		  founded and edited the scholarly journal, the
		  South Atlantic
			 Quarterly; and encouraged his students to publish
		  and fostered their interests in Southern history. In 1903,
		  Bassett published an article,
		  Stirring Up the Fires of
			 Race Antipathy in the
		  South Atlantic
			 Quarterly, that praised the accomplishments of
		  African Americans and offered views on how to improve race
		  relations. Bassett's views brought on a controversy that
		  became known as the
		  Bassett Affair that
		  helped to establish the concept of academic freedom in
		  higher education in the United States. The collection
		  contains personal and professional papers related to the
		  life and work of John Spencer Bassett. Materials range in
		  date from 1802 to 1998 (bulk 1893-1911) and include
		  biographical information, correspondence, printed material,
		  newspaper clippings, manuscripts, and souvenirs.
