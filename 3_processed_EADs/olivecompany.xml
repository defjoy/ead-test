         <abstract>The Olive Company was based in Clarinda, Ia. Collection comprises printed material supporting the purchase of the National Bust Developer, a vacuum appliance. Includes an advertising pamphlet (15 pgs.) for "perfect bust development," an order blank, and a sheet of endorsements. The advertising pamphlet explains flat-chestedness as follows: "In the natural order of things, maternity would have occurred early enough to prevent the loss of the busts. The development of the busts is greatly dependent upon the maternal instincts. The tendency of the day is to postpone marriage much beyond the age demanded by Nature. Hence it is that there are a multitude of women who are well developed in all other respects, but find to their chagrin that the busts are gradually disappearing." (p. 6) </abstract>
