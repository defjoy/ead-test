         <abstract>Employee of the Lepetkatta Tea Co., Ltd., in Barbaru, Assam, India. Cole signed his letters "Johnson." Collection comprises weekly letters Johnson wrote to his parents in England while he served as an engineer for a tea estate, and provides commentary written from a late-colonial perspective. There is information regarding the management of the tea estate, tea manufacture, tea prices and trade, and the transformation of work processes and personal lives by mechanization, the introduction of electricity, and brick making. In addition, Johnson wrote about local customs, labor, wildlife, weather, religious festivals, disease outbreaks (esp. cholera), and Indian politics. He also wrote about various engine repairs he undertook; transportation; his favorite pastimes (including hunting and playing polo); his various horses and pets; medical and dental treatments; people he met; as well as his activities in the volunteer British military guard, where he participated in military tests, drills, and sports, and served as Farrier Sergeant. His final letters contained extensive commentary on England's role in World War I, as well as the impact of the war on Assam. Includes a few postcards, one photograph, a clipping, and a tea invoice. There is also one undated letter written to Johnson by a native missionary who requested assistance. </abstract>
