         <abstract>William H. Shockley was an American-born mining engineer and amateur photographer. The collection contains the prints and negatives of thousands of black and white photographs taken by William Shockley during his travels as a mining engineer in China, Korea, India, Western Australia, and Russia (including Siberia) between the years of 1897 and 1905, shortly before and during the period of the Boxer Rebellion. Subjects featured include native citizens and officials (some of high rank), Europeans and Indians (including miners, soldiers, officials, missionaries, and guards), mining and engineering concerns (particularly of gold and coal in China), native dwellings and villages, religious buildings and art, street scenes, camps, landscapes, landscape features such as unusual trees and rock formations, domestic animals, caravans and other forms of transportation. There are many other work scenes in addition to mining settings. The collection contains approximately 2505 images and over 200 negatives. Many of the photographs are captioned. There is also a small quantity of Shockley's correspondence dating from 1905-1922. Arranged in series by format and by geographical location. Acquired as part of the Archive for Documentary Arts.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>William Hillman Shockley (1855-1925) was an American mining engineer and amateur photographer. He worked and traveled in Russia, Korea, Australia, and China, and was active in the Chinese mining regions during the same approximate period when another American, Herbert Hoover, also worked as a young mining engineer. Shockley was the father of William B. Shockley, inventor of the transistor and winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics (1956). He married May Bradford, who had been a federal deputy surveyor of the mineral lands. The Shockley's son William B. was born in England in 1910; they returned to the U.S. in 1913. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection contains the prints and negatives of thousands of black and white photographs taken by William Shockley during his travels as a mining engineer in China (including Manchuria), Korea, India, Western Australia, and Russia (including Siberia) between the years of 1897 and 1905, shortly before and during the period of the Boxer Rebellion. Subjects featured include native citizens and officials (some of high rank), Europeans and Indians (including miners, missionaries, guards, soldiers, and officials), mining and engineering concerns (particularly of gold and coal in China), native dwellings and villages, religious buildings and art, street scenes, camps, landscapes, landscape features such as unusual trees and rock formations, domestic animals, caravans and other forms of transportation. There are many other work scenes in addition to mining settings. Further details on Shockley's images from China can be found under selected geographical headings below. The collection contains approximately 2505 images, with four mounted prints, 258 8x10 prints, and the remainder primarily 3x5 and 4x6; there are also 245 original negatives, 134 of which are glass plates (closed to use). Many of the photographs are captioned. There is also a small quantity of Shockley's correspondence dating from 1905-1922. Included in the collection is a set of 53 8x10 black and white prints that are reproductions made from glass plate negatives in a private collection; a small subset includes images of an estate in England, with a portrait of an unidentified man in uniform, and images of people playing tennis. Arranged in series by format and by geographical location. Acquired as part of the Archive for Documentary Arts.</p>

               <p>A bound volume of carbon copies of Shockley's correspondence, written from Paris, St. Petersburg, Irdell (Russia), Bogoslak (Russia), London, Palo Alto, California, and Reno, Nevada. The majority of this correspondence relates to Shockley's work as a mining engineer, as well as several personal letters to his wife and others, correspondence relating to his personal finances, and responses to a correspondence course entitled "Training of Children." The volume also contains several diary entries from 1922 and notes on the Kluchi mines in Russia. Four letters are in German.</p>

               <p>Consists of approximately 2505 black and white photographic prints from Shockley's travels as a mining engineer at the turn of the century to Australia, Russia, China, Korea, India. Included are many images taken in Siberia and Manchuria. Most of the prints were developed out contemporaneously, others were developed in the 2000s from original negatives. Titles are taken from Shockley's original labels.</p>
               
               <p>The images include many topics and subjects, including landscapes, street scenes, crowd scenes, portraits, and group shots, posed and spontaneous. Frequently depicted are modes of transportation (horseback, donkey, camel, horse, cow, person-drawn carts, trains, steamers, canoes); agricultural activities and locales; mining activities (panning, surveying, drilling, carrying water, construction, machinery); religious objects, processions, and buildings; hunting; and architecture. There are many work settings in addition to mining, as well as depictions of commercial enterprises.  Further details are offered under selected geographical groups below. Fifteen folders contain modern gelatin silver 8x10 prints printed from the photographer's negatives of Russia. Some of the 8x10 prints are duplicates that appear in the "Russia, 1905" folder. Unless otherwise noted, the majority of the prints are 3x4".</p>

                  <p>Chin Chang Kou Liang is located in a mountainous region north and north-west of Beijing, noted for its quartz gold deposits. Images depict native people and local officers, as well as houses, villages, a theater, a temple, and a market square in Chin Chang Kou Liang. There are local landscape features such as the Great Wall in Kou Pei Kou, bridges, and rivers. The majority of the photographs, however, concern mining operations, which include making gold washing and smelting ore to extract gold.</p>
