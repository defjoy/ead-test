         <abstract>Although the exact provenance of the property plats is unknown, it is indicated on the reverse side of some plats that the surveys were used by A. C. Lee, Chief Engineer of the Duke Construction Company and the plats may have been created by the Atlantic Realty Company. This collection includes approximately 100 survey plats of Duke University properties prior to the construction on East Campus and West Campus from the years 1925-1926. Also included are plats representing the Duke Homestead from 1932 that were possibly drawn by V.A. Stewman.</abstract>

On the reverse side of some plats, it is indicated that the surveys were used by A. C. Lee, Chief Engineer of the Duke Construction Company and the plats may have been produced by the Atlantic Realty Company. Also included are plats representing the Duke Homestead from 1932 that were possibly drawn by V.A. Stewman. Topics include Duke Construction Company, East Campus, West Campus, Duke Forest and the Duke Homestead.</p>
