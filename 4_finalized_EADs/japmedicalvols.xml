         <abstract>The sixty-three manuscript volumes in this collection
                range from 10 to 154 pages, and were created in Japan from about 1810 to 1849,
                chiefly by medical students. The notebooks usually take one of two forms:
                transcriptions of lectures and demonstrations, and bodies of knowledge written up as
                manuals by well-known Japanese physicians of the time, especially Hanaoka
                Seish&#363; and Takenaka Bunp&#333;. Topics covered include herbal medicines and
                other prescriptions; treatments for diseases of the eyes and other parts of the
                head; surgery, particularly for cancers, tumors, and fistulas; breast cancer;
                smallpox; scurvy; osteopathy; treatment of wounds; suturing; hematology; gynecology
                and obstetrics; and pediatric medicine. Some notebooks contain black-and-white and color
                hand-drawn illustrations - many full-page - of surgeries, close-ups of suturing,
                bandages and wrappings, osteopathic manipulations, and medicinal plants. In most
                cases, the author or copyist recorded details such the place and time of the lecture
                and the name of the medical school. There are references in the notes to at least a
                dozen other contemporary or earlier physicians, and to earlier dates for the work
                being copied - these range from 1677 to 1796. Acquired as part of the History of
                Medicine Collections at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Historical and Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>At the time when these volumes were written in the first quarter of the 19th century,
                Japanese medical practice was quite advanced due to a melding of Chinese,
                Portuguese, and Dutch medical practices, and the pioneering advances of Japanese
                physicians. By the early 1800s there were a number of medical schools in Japan, two
                of which are mentioned in the notebooks: Shunrinken (&#26149; &#26519; &#36562;),
                Hanaoka Seish&#363;'s medical school located in Wakayama prefecture; and
                Seibid&#333; (&#28168; &#32654; &#22530;), located in Ky&#333;to, led by Takenaka
                Bunp&#333;. Some of the early medical schools such as Shunrinken graduated hundreds
                of medical students within a short period. Copying lecture notes and materia medica
                was part of the learning process, and resulted in a kind of manuscript medical
                manual that was then used for further studies or copied and passed down to other
                students. Several of the notebooks in this collection refer to bodies of knowledge
                originally authored by Hanaoka Seish&#363; and Takenaka Bunp&#333;.</p>
         
         <p>Hanaoka Seish&#363; (&#33775; &#23713; &#38738; &#27954;) (1760-1835) was most known
                for his study and teaching of herbal medicine, surgical techniques, and the
                treatment of cancers, fistulas, and other serious ailments; he was also well-known
                for his pioneering use of general anesthesia long before it was first attempted by
                Western physicians. He advocated for the adoption of Western medicine as practiced
                by Dutch physicians, allying it with traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, which
                focused on herbal and mineral preparations.</p>
         
         <p>Takenaka Bunp&#333; (&#31481; &#20013; &#25991; &#36628;) (1766-1836), also known as
                Takenaka Bisai and Takenaka Nanp&#333;, studied in Kyoto under Wada T&#333;kaku and
                specialized in surgical techniques and smallpox treatments. </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The sixty-three Japanese manuscript volumes in this collection were created from 1810
                to 1849, chiefly by medical students, and document Japanese medical training and
                practice during the time also known as the Edo period, and the conjoining of
                Chinese-inspired <emph render="italic">materia medica</emph> with current Western
                medical practices introduced primarily by the Dutch. The notebooks range in length
                from 10 to 154 pages, and typically take the form of transcriptions of lectures and
                demonstrations; in many cases the writer recorded the place and time of the
                demonstration and the name of the medical school. There are also volumes which
                represent the collected knowledge of well-known Japanese physicians of the time,
                especially Hanaoka Seish&#363; but also Takenaka Bunsuke (Nanp&#333;). There are
                references in the notes to at least a dozen other contemporary or earlier
                physicians.</p>
         
         <p>The copyists and note-takers signed their names at the end of the volumes; the name
                Yamanaka Sh&#363;sai Hideyuki appears most frequently; also appearing frequently are
                the names of editors and proofreaders, and corrections and later annotations in red
                ink are found in a number of the manuscripts. In addition to the contemporary dates,
                there are many references to the earlier manuscript versions being copied: these
                dates range from 1677 to 1796.</p>
         
         <p>The topics covered by the volumes range widely, and include: herbal medicine and
                other prescriptions; treatments for diseases of the eye and other parts of the head;
                surgery, particularly on cancers, swellings, and fistulas; breast cancer; smallpox;
                scurvy; osteopathy; the treatment of wounds; hematology; gynecology and obstetrics;
                and pediatric medicine. There are several volumes containing illustrative drawings,
                some hand-colored and others are black-and-white; they include detailed images of
                surgical procedures and close-ups of suturing; examples of bandages and wrappings;
                osteopathic manipulations; and medicinal plants.</p>
         
         <p>One volume in particular stands out above the rest, consisting of over ninety
                carefully drawn, full-page, hand-coloured illustrations, nine of which are
                double-page, displaying patients with dislocated limbs, skin cancer, or requiring
                sophisticated bandages, as well as illustrations of internal organs and one page
                with surgical instruments. One of the illustrations is a realistic portrait of
                Hanaoka Seish&#363;, with a beard and spectacles (probably imported from Holland),
                showing him excising a cyst from a patient. At the end of the volume, two different
                explanatory texts in Kanbun (classical Chinese read in the Japanese manner) provide
                comments in the volume about the diseases and their treatment.</p>
         
         <p>Each codex in the collection is composed of leaves of rice paper, with hand-sewn
                bindings and soft covers, and calligraphy in black and red ink. Some of the texts
                are written in Shino Japanese (Chinese reading style) using all Kanji characters,
                while other texts are in Shino Japanese written in 19th-century characters - the
                language of the educated class in Japan. At least one volume (Vol. 21) contains
                Dutch words for medicinal compounds. The script reads back to front; the script is
                laid out in vertical columns that are read from right to left across the page. In
                some cases, pages or sections and covers are missing, and some volumes bear traces
                of insect damage, but for the most part, the volumes are remarkably
                well-preserved.</p>
         
         <p>All titles are taken when possible from the covers or from section headings;
                approximate translations in English provided by library staff and are in brackets.
                In the case of missing titles, a title was supplied from content by library staff.
                Titles and significant names are also given in Japanese characters, and some older
                calendar dates are also given in modern Western dates. Illegible or untranslatable
                text is indicated by blank lines.</p>
         
         <p>Volumes are arranged in this collection guide in two series: sets of notebooks, and
                single volumes. The items in the sets are linked by common themes or bodies of
                knowledge, and range from two to eleven volumes. They include collections of works
                by one physician, as well as sets of manuals and lecture notes on topics such as
                obstetrics and gynecology, metallurgy, opthalmology, pox and skin diseases, and
                others. Single volumes are housed after the sets.</p>

               <p>The notebooks gathered in sets are linked by common themes or bodies of
                        knowledge, and range from two to eleven volumes. They include collections of
                        works by one physician, as well as sets of manuals and lecture notes on
                        topics such as obstetrics and gynecology, metallurgy, opthalmology, pox and
                        skin diseases, and others. Single volumes are listed after the multi-volume
                        sets.</p>
               
               <p>All titles are taken when possible from the covers or from section headings;
                        approximate translations in English provided by library staff and are in
                        brackets. Titles and significant names are also given in Japanese
                        characters. Each volume has been assigned a unique institutional
                        identifier.</p>

                  <p>This set of five notebooks is a copy of one of Dr. Futei Fukui's most
                            famous works, a guide to medicinal compounds containing herbs and
                            minerals for various illnesses: neuralgia, gout, beriberi, stitch,
                            gonorrheal infection, intestinal torsion, and others. All the notebooks
                            contain an index. Volumes 3 and 4 have extensive insect damage. Fukui
                            was a doctor in Kyoto but he was called to Edo by the shogunate in
                            1790.</p>

                                The sections consist of lectures by Hanaoka Seish&#363; and possibly
                                other individuals; topics include case studies of various kinds,
                                breast cancer, and scurvy. Most of the lectures seem to have taken
                                place in late July 1827. In all cases, the writer adds his name to
                                the text. </p>

                  <p>This group of manuals covers many topics related to obstetrics and
                            gynecology: childbirth techniques, surgical methods, diagnostic
                            techniques, and female diseases and treatments. The content includes
                            case studies. Most of the notebooks have tables of contents, and most
                            have titles. The group begins with a set of five notebooks, followed by
                            several smaller sets.</p>

                  <p>Shunrinken (&#26149;&#26519;&#36562;) is the name of Dr. Seishu's medical
                            school. Kasho means "family book," which refers to the intellectual
                            legacy of the "family" Hana ke (&#33775;&#23478;) (a shortened form of
                            Hanaoka, the famous physician). The date is probably incorrectly
                            written, because Tsuchinoto Mi is the second year of K&#333;ka era
                            rather than the Bunsei era [1845]. It is more likely the year Tsuchinoe
                            Ne [1828] in the Bunsei era.</p>
