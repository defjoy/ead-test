         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Benjamin Ulysses Ratchford was born in Gastonia,
		  N.C. on Sept. 7, 1902, to Joseph F. and Marietta Ratchford.
		  He earned a B.S. from Davidson College (1926), and earned
		  the first doctorate in economics awarded by Duke University
		  in 1932. After serving briefly as an economics instructor
		  at Cornell University (1927-1928), Ratchford returned to
		  Duke and joined the faculty of the Economics Department in
		  1928. While at Duke, Ratchford authored several books, such
		  as
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American State Debts</title>
		(1941),
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Berlin Reparations
		  Assignment</title> (with W. D. Ross, 1947),
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Impact of Federal Policies
		  on the Economy of the South</title> (with Calvin B. Hoover,
		1949),
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Economic Resources and
		  Policies of the South</title> (with Calvin B. Hoover,
		1951),
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Economy of Turkey</title>
		(with others, 1951), and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Public Expenditures in
		  Australia</title> (1959), as well as numerous articles in
		professional journals. </p>
         
         <p>He also served in a number of official positions,
		  including Raleigh District Price Officer for the Office of
		  Price Administration (1942-1943), Instructor in the Army
		  Finance School (1943-1944), Economic Advisor for Level of
		  Industry in the Office of Military Government for Germany
		  in Berlin (1945-1946), Deputy Chief of the Office of
		  Program Review for the Economic Cooperation Administration
		  in Paris (1948), and Chief Economist for the International
		  Bank Reconstruction and Development Mission to Turkey
		  (1950). Ratchford received the Medal of Freedom in 1946 for
		  his work on German reparations, awarded by the War
		  Department to civilians performing meritorious service
		  overseas during World War II. Davidson College awarded him
		  a Citation of Merit in 1948, an honor made on the basis of
		  a national poll of Davidson alumni.</p>
         
         <p>Ratchford was also a member of the board of
		  editors of the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Southern Economic
		  Journal</title> (1941-1945) and of the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">American Economic
		  Review</title> (1946-1949), and he directed research for
		the National Planning Association's Committee of the South.
		He was a member of the American Finance Association, the
		National Tax Association, the American Economic
		Association, and the Southern Economic Association
		(President, 1952-1953).</p>
         
         <p>In 1960, Ratchford left Duke to become vice
		  president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va. He
		  retired from that position in 1967, and returned to Durham,
		  N.C.</p>
         
         <p>He married Laura B. Deaton in 1932; they had two
		  children. Benjamin U. Ratchford died Jan. 20, 1977.</p>

               <p>This series contains correspondence with a
				variety of individuals and organizations. Early
				correspondence includes letters from Ratchford's friends
				and colleagues during World War II. Other correspondence
				from this time relates to Ratchford's work on the economy
				of post-war Germany. The later correspondence relates to
				Ratchford's roles as professor, researcher, economic
				advisor, and editor. In 1959, the correspondence documents
				a Ford Foundation grant to conduct a study of the economy
				of the South. In a letter at the end of 1959, Ratchford
				gives advice to Duke President A. Hollis Edens just before
				his resignation. Correspondence in 1960 outlines
				Ratchford's transition to his position as vice president of
				the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Letters in 1977 were
				notes of sympathy to Ratchford's family. An additional
				folder contains correspondence and autographs collected by
				Laura Ratchford. These materials feature autographs and
				autograph facsimiles of politicians.</p>
