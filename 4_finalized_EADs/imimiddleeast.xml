         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The International Monitor Institute Records, Middle East Videotapes span the dates 1991-2008, and comprise audiovisual materials related to IMI's documentation of contemporary conflicts and human rights violations in the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon. The bulk of these audiovisual materials are comprised of documentaries and news reports that cover the political climates, histories, and governmental structures of Middle-Eastern states, especially Iraq and Iran. Much of this material documents Saddam Hussein's Kurdish Genocide (al-Anfal) and his campaign against the Marsh Arabs, activities of the Iraqi secret police, and the experience of Kurdish refugees in camps such as Azerbaijani. Material also documents humanitarian relief for Kurdish refugees, including the activities of the United States military in Operation Provide Comfort. Other documentary material explores state torture and state-sponsored terrorism in Iraq, including chemical attacks and the genetic effects of chemical weapons on the population. Records further document various political and military institutions, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party (KPP), Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), as well as the activity of various international organizations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. Several documentaries examine events leading up to the Gulf War and its aftermath, the war in Beirut, the lives of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, and rights conflicts regarding Palestinians living in Israel. Videotapes further document the Iranian revolution and post-revolution, and the fall of the Shah. The bulk of news reports were produced by CNN, Fox, Frontline, and Al-Jazeera. Coverage focuses on the September 11, 2011 attacks on the World Trade Center, as well as material on the war on terror, Osama bin Laden and Al Queda training camps. The following tapes were not transferred to the Rubenstein Library and descriptions of these tapes has been omitted from this finding aid: ME048, ME054-ME057, ME059-ME067, ME070-ME071, ME073-ME074, ME102-ME103, ME112, ME204-ME206, ME291, ME350, ME417, ME1074.Further organizational material on the Middle East can be found in the International Monitor Institute Records, also at the Rubenstein Library.</p>

                     <item>We offer a look into Iraq's Southern Marshes. Living an ancient life style the Marsh Arabs are a unique race. They're fighting for autonomy from Baghdad.  Iraqi rulers have historically accepted the isolation of the Marsh Arabs but not Sadaam Hussein. He is determined to bring them into line. Apart from daily bombardments his army has nearly completed a vast engineering project to drain the marshes. It will allow easy access for his forces. Unique British Royal Air force film shows the engineering work to divert the Euphrates river. Recent footage from inside the marshes depicts the increasingly difficult battles they face. On the Iranian border thousands of refugees have fled the attacks and live in makeshift camps. Other strong footage of Iraqi human rights abuses. The rushes footage also includes Iraqi soldiers ill-treating Marsh Arab prisoners, life inside the Marshes and refugee camps, a children's hospital in Baghdad, Iraqi citizens selling their household goods in Baghdad as they try to survive under the sanctions and footage from Basra - the nearest Iraqi controlled city to the Marshes. Interviews with Marsh Arab organizations and European representatives of Marsh Arab rebels.</item>

                     <item>The Kurdish people of the city of Dohuk have seen little peace. This feature records their desperate hunt for shelter from the merciless Iraqi regime after the failure of the 1991 Kurdish rebellion. After the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein's regime was at it's lowest ebb, the Kurdish people rose up. The war-weary Iraqis simply packed their bags and left and the jubilant Kurds destroyed all signs of the regime. They produce macabre Iraqi security Police documents ordering the elimination of 95 percent of 'unfriendly' demonstrators with the other five percent to be interrogated. Iraqi retaliation came swiftly. They shelled Dahok and soon hospital wards were full of bloodied faces of children caught by shrapnel.  The city's people fled into the mountains leaving everything they owned, as Iraqi helicopters, which US president George Bush promised would never attack, swooped down. The Kurds were stopped from crossing into Turkey and were forced to march 60km to a remote mountain pass where they camped, waiting for a change in their tragic fortunes.</item>

                     <item>A new Kurdish war. Ferocious battles have broken out between Turkish and Iraqi Kurds. Iraqi Kurds, in cooperation with the Turks, have taken up arms against their Kurdish brethren, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) guerilla army. Now the PKK guerrillas, about 10,000 of them, are caught between the Turks and Iraq's Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.</item>
                     
                     <item>When Iraq's Kurds won their freedom from Saddam Hussein their victory inspired Turkey and Iran's 12 million Kurds to fight harder than ever for their own freedom. This summer the PKK caused havoc in South East Turkey, plunging vast areas into all out war. The PKK have been using Northern Iraq to train and camp their fighters, helping them vastly with the logistics of their war.</item>
                     
                     <item>Now Turkey, by threatening to close their border with Iraq, has forced the Peshmerga to join in battle against the PKK guerrillas. The PKK in turn have also threatened to close all routes into Iraq, asking the humanitarian relief which Iraqi Kurds need to get through the winter. Tension in Southern Turkey is at an all time high with daily battles, towns on strike, and resentment bubbling. This feature covers the mountain battles, the position of the Iraqi Kurds and the tension in Southeast Asia.</item>

                     <item>Christianne Amanpour documentary about the situation in Iran, mixed in with her personal story of her family and their experience with the revolution and exile to the United States. "The only question now is how will the revolution end?" Includes mixture of old archival footage with footage of contemporary Iran. The story privileges the tales of Western oriented young people who would rather party and listen to rap music than participate in the Iranian revolution. Emphasis on the "desire" for these western, English speaking, upper class Iranians to lead a double life and participate in behavior illegal in the Iran of today. Includes photo and testimony of a man who was punished for participating in parties, describing this as a way of "resisting" the revolution, a "desire for freedom over fear". Also footage of the protests and riots on the campus of Tehran University during the summer of 1999, including women protesting. Hardline police beat and punished the students. Includes interviews with the organizers of the student protests. Also includes interviews with members of her family about her family history and support of the revolution. Also includes reports on the use of the internet in Iran and the desire for Western music and films, again on the part of the wealthy Iranian upper classes. Also interviews with college student, Fatemeh Haghighajou, who is religious and yet wants freedom in Iranian society and wants an interpretation of Islam based on reform movement of Iranian president Khatami. She is also elected to the new Iranian Parliament. Also an interview with Muvadi Savogi, one of the hardest of the hardliners in the Iranian government about the desire for reforms and freedoms. Includes reports on freedom of the press, which has since been repressed, Amanpour calls it the battleground of ideas. "Democracy is being born in these newspapers." Includes report on publisher Hamid Reza Jalalaipour. Shows the journalist to be deeply religious and yet against the regime.</item>

                     <item>The film documents the exile from Palestine of Muslims by the Israelis both during 1948 and 1967. Palestinians are forced to live in Lebanon, refugees from the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians who belong to Hamas who are forced to live in the boundary between Lebanon and Israel. They were exiled from the West Bank and Gaza and created a small Islamic republic in the mountains of southern Lebanon. They feel bitter anger the west and Israel. Fisk interviews Hamas fighters who talk about reasons for fighting. Fisk travels from Beirut to Palestine through Cyprus and then travels to Gaza from Jerusalem to witness first hand the Kafkaesque labyrinth of travelling from Beirut to Palestine in the days before the hand over of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority headed by Yasser Arafat. He describes the desolation of the situation in Gaza. He also films the direct actions of the Israeli army as they occupy and enforce curfews in Gaza. He also documents the destruction of Palestinian homes by the Israelis and the military occupation that is a routine part of daily life in Palestine. In the second part he documents the role of Hamas in aiding the people in Gaza, particularly those who were killed by Hamas for collaborating with the Israelis. Interviews Hamas members in Gaza about whether the struggle is a national struggle or a struggle for God, an Islamic struggle, says it's a war between religions not a war between nations. A Hamas gunman is killed in Gaza and then destroyed all the surrounding Palestinian homes in random violence. Part three continues with a report about a Jewish settlement in the heart of Arab land in Gaza and interviews with Jewish settlers. Continues with the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel and the huge Jewish settlement cities built on Palestinian land. Documents a Palestinian family who is clinging to their orchard in the shadow of Israeli settlements and orders to give up their land by the Israeli state. Includes footage of bulldozers plowing up the land for settlements right next to the land of the Khatibs, who are attempting to stay on their land. Lawyer details case that the family is trying to make and the reply of the Israelis that the land is to be used by Jews and Jews only, you are not a member of the public that this land is to serve. The next part follows Fisk's journey to Acre where he finds the home of the Palestinian exiled in Lebanon. He goes to the home and finds an Israelis living there who moved in two years after he was forced into exile and was unable to return. Fisk then travels to Poland and the town where this Israeli was originally from and then to the Treblinka concentration camp where his mother was killed.</item>

                     <item>In this part of the series Fisk starts out in Egypt describing the violence perpetrated against tourists there in the early 1990's. Includes footage of the assassination of President Sadat by Islamic fundamentalists as well as interviews with members of the Gama'a Islamiyya about the attempts to create an Islamic state. Discusses the divide between the rich and poor, as well as the police role in torturing Islamic suspects. Also, details the disastrous effects on the tourist trade in Egypt. Part two has Fisk travelling to Bosnia, where the Islamic faith is under siege by Serbian and Croat forces. He discusses the war's effects on the Bosnia Muslim population and the loss of faith that help from the West will come. Film was made when Sarajevo under siege still by Serb forces. Interviews with Bosnian civilians and UN military personnel about the situation of the bombardment.  Includes footage from the hospitals in Sarajevo that document the daily carnage caused by the sniper fire. Interviews with Bosnia Muslim fighters in Sarajevo, as well as some background on the history of Islam in Bosnia. A Muslim cleric comments on the feelings of betrayal the Bosnia Muslims have towards the west. Part three begins with a trip to the North of Bosnia where Fisk describes the Serb offensive as ethnic cleansing and a push to steal the Muslim land. He visits a mosque that he had visited a year before that was not destroyed with the Imam gone missing. Fisk excoriates Western governments for ignoring the problems of Muslims in the Middle East. Ends with Bosnian Muslims being sent into exile, powerful symbolic images of people being put on trains and sent away.</item>

                     <item>For centuries Kurdish nomads have freely crossed the mountainous borders which officially split their homeland. Iran is determined to divide up the Kurds and is spending millions on new roads and military bases along its border with Iraq. It wants to quench support among the Iraqi Kurds for the separatist Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI). KDPI fighters have based themselves in villages in Northern Iraq in preparation for their campaign in Iran. From their mountain vantage points Kurds watch Iranian shells destroy their homes. Torn apart between four countries, the shelling is a stark reminder of just how vulnerable the Kurdish nation is.</item>

                     <item>Kurdish officials in Turkey wonder whether Saddam Hussein will ever sign an agreement for true Kurdish autonomy. The fight for a Kurdish state has been led for over forty years by wealthy landowners. But now a new force has emerged; the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), or Kurdish Workers&#8217; Party. This film follows the PKK as they move along the mountainous border between Turkish and Iraqi Kurdistan. The border between Turkey and Iraq has been swept away by the UN-declared safe-haven and the PKK are garnering support from Iraqi Kurds. The PKK teach a Maoist philosophy to their recruits and, uniquely among Middle Eastern people, the women study, live and fight along with the men.</item>

                     <item>A story of betrayal and Saddam&#8217;s revenge remaining deeply pertinent despite ongoing fighting and shifting territories. In a poignant inquiry into the strange wars of Kurdistan, the lush Babylonian mountains of Northern Iraq host again the ancient rivalry which has bedeviled the Kurdish regions. The fighting between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) was triggered by the former&#8217;s deal with Saddam. Massoud Barzani, the KDP leader, and architect of the Kurdish deal with Saddam, insists he would not have dealt with the Iraqi leader if the West had agreed to assist the Kurds of Iraq. The aim of the Iraqi National Congress, a Kurdish organisation run closely with the US, is to destabilise Saddam Hussein. At their compound in Erbil Kurds who helped the Iraqi National Congress (INC) still live in fear of Iraqi agents in the town. Hundreds of their compatriots were executed by the Iraqis when the KDP Kurds and the Iraqi troops first took the city. Barzani, the KDP leader, denies that Iraqi agents are still in Kurdistan. In Halabja memories of the gas attack in 1988 are still fresh. The ruins and survivors of those terrible days remind everyone just how bad things could get if Saddam comes back.</item>

                     <item>The fallout from depleted uranium shells used in the Gulf War is today a political hotcake. What is the reality of depleted uranium (DU) pollution in Iraq and what effects are in store for Kosovans and Serbs? In the hospitals of Basra doctors are speaking of a crime against humanity. Flicking though his casebook from the last four years, Doctor Abdul Karin shows pictures of babies born without skin, with over-sized heads and with noses where a mouth should be. Doctors here firmly point the finger of blame at the Allies&#8217; use of Depleted Uranium shells during the Gulf War. Over a million rounds of the weapon were fired during the short and decisive round of bombing. Favoured for its armour piercing qualities, a DU bomb penetrates its target with intense radioactive heat, incinerating its victims. &#8220;It&#8217;s . . . a flash, bang sort of toaster,&#8221; describes Nuclear Consultant John Range. Once detonated DU particles remain radioactive for 4000 million years. Irradiated particles travel on the wind polluting water and soil and entering the food chain. If the Iraqi doctors here are right, the West is responsible for immense suffering. Jisn Mohamed is in hospital for her third caesarean. She&#8217;s already borne four deformed babies. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what they bring out of me . . . I&#8217;m very scared, in fact I&#8217;m petrified.&#8221; Lying on her bed after the operation, without painkillers thanks to economic sanctions, the doctors have to tell her that her baby is again deformed and probably won&#8217;t survive. British investigators into Gulf War syndrome deny that DU could be responsible for the scale of cancers and congenital defects afflicting Iraq. DU in the quantities used in the shells should not, they say present a serious hazard. Tests on British soldiers have produced &#8220;no convincing evidence that Uranium represents a hazard to people.&#8221; So could the reasons for Iraq&#8217;s health problems lie elsewhere, including Saddam Hussein's own use of chemical weapons? We speak exclusively to former head of Iraqi intelligence Wafiq Samarrai. He claims that Saddam is using the issue of DU as propaganda, to arouse international indignation and force the West to finally abolish economic sanctions. Iraq, he says, was already heavily contaminated before the Allies dropped their DU bombs. Chemical weapons were used against Iran and the Kurds in the North.  But with government minders following every move in Iraq it&#8217;s difficult to get to the truth. Depleted uranium has now been used in the heart of Europe. The same questions about cancer rates and birth defects will soon be being asked in Kosovo. And the true danger represented by depleted uranium is set to become an increasingly controversial topic. Especially if it turns out that the West which has accused Saddam Hussein of amassing weapons of mass destruction, has itself used radioactive and chemically toxic weapons against Iraq.</item>

                     <item>Metal towers, topped by roaring flames, rise up out of a flat, gravely desert. This is one of Kuwait&#8217;s many oil fields. In less than 5 years the black, viscous substance that took Kuwait and the West to war rebuilt Kuwait city. In defence of Kuwait&#8217;s promise to introduce democratic reform after the war, a member of the ruling Al Sabah family rejects &#8216;Western democracy&#8217; but maintains that open debate operates through parliament, the press and private gatherings. In opulent tents and gilded palaces, the ruling elite of Kuwait meet to play cards and to discuss sex, religion and politics. By Arab standards, this offers a model of political freedom. Kuwaitis are a minority in their own country. They live off the menial work of &#8216;guest workers.&#8217; Before the war, 400,000 Palestinians were part of this workforce until Yasser Arafat&#8217;s dealings with Saddam Hussein turned them all into collaborators. Near the Iraqi border, a UN force from Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations, holds fort for one of the richest. All the ceremonial garb and military band playing does little to diminish the threat that Saddam Hussein still poses for this small, oil rich state.</item>

                     <item>It's 1000 km journey from Jordan to Baghdad, the only way to enter the sanctioned city. When international sanctions were placed on Iraq, the country was allowed to sell oil for food, medicine, and humanitarian supplies for the people. But we speak to the former UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Hans Von Sponeck, to get the full story. "We know goods are entering the country&#8230;we have no control . . . this is really a hypocrisy." It's become a war of propaganda on both sides. Saddam Hussein will smuggle out about a billion dollars worth of oil this year, which he will spend keeping his men well-fed and well-armed. Almost a decade after sanctions were imposed, Iraq's first-world health care has been reduced to third-world disaster. "We used to have 2-3 deaths per week . . . now 2 to 3 deaths every day," says one disheartened doctor. Both sides accuse the other of this mess. Who's to blame?</item>

                     <item>Memories of the 1990 Iraqi invasion are still fresh in the minds of Kuwaitis. A Kuwaiti mother tells us of her daily pain. Her son is still a POW in Iraq. If she could get to Iraq she tells us, &#8220;If I see Saddam I will kiss his feet to release my son.&#8221; But the Kuwaiti government knows its security lies in kissing America&#8217;s feet not Saddams'. &#8220;We are a small nation, we cannot defend ourselves.&#8221; As long as Saddam reigns they can&#8217;t feel completely secure in their desert island of wealth and privelege. But while the tension continues their wildly pro-US stance sours relations elsewhere. Throughout the Arab world the anger is more frequently over Israeli aggression and not Iraqi. In his Baqra shop, the local butcher reiterates the commonly aired sentiment. &#8220;You call Saddam a dictator and say he starves the Iraqi people, but what about the Palestinian people? Or don&#8217;t the Palestinian people have the right to live freely and peacefully.&#8221;</item>

                     <item>A leading Iraqi human rights activist Dr Al Hakim visits the Marshes in the extreme south of Iraq and finds evidence of an escalating military campaign against the Marsh Arabs. The jet fighter attacks stopped after the no-fly zone was declared but the Iraqis still shell the Arabs by mortar. Like the Iranians the marsh people are Shia Muslims whereas the Iraqis are Sunnis.  Most families are missing relatives and people have been tortured and every day Iraq is closer to destroying their fragile existence. The Iraqis are also draining the Marsh Arabs&#8217; homeland by diverting the rivers which feed it. Contains shocking pictures of an execution of three Kurds by Iraqi soldiers, and black and white footage of Iraqi attacks on another of its minority groups, the Kurds, in 1988.</item>

                     <item>CNN Documentary on the aftermath of the Gulf War and the ability of Saddam Hussein to stay in power despite the force arrayed against him.</item>

                     <item>Ten years ago, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pledged his troops to the "Mother of all Battles," but Operation Desert Storm then quickly drove his armies from Kuwait. Yet, despite Iraq's crushing military collapse and a decade of crippling sanctions, Hussein still holds power in Iraq, seemingly unshaken by plots to eliminate him.</item>
                     
                     <item>In the decade since the end of Desert Storm, much has changed. Iraq, once an outcast on the world stage, is now coming in from the cold.</item>
                     
                     <item>The once-united Western alliance has given way to a divided United Nations. Hussein has ruled Iraq for almost 25 years. Some say with an iron hand.</item>
                     
                     <item>"I think Saddam as a person represents one of the darkest forces in modern Arab history," says U.S. Assistant Secretary of State David Welch. "Here is a person who, for the sake of his own grasp for power and ambition, has been willing to execute hundreds, thousands, of his own citizens.</item>
                     
                     <item>Former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft believes that Hussein is "one of the most ruthless people that the world has ever seen."</item>
                     
                     <item>"One of the reasons he has been so successful," Scowcroft says, "is that he terrifies everyone who works for him - like personally executing people in front of his colleagues, or having somebody execute his best friend to show his loyalty."</item>
                     
                     <item>Said K. Aburish, author of "Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge," calls the Iraqi leader "a thug." "But a thug who is the most methodical Arab leader of this century," he adds. Aburish says Hussein is tribal in his thinking.</item>
                     
                     <item>"You can look at him as two people - a man who operates out of the 17th century. And a man whose foot is in the 20th century and he's marching very fast into the 21st century," Aburish explains. </item>
                     
                     <item>And time and again, his ambitions for himself and for his nation have led him into conflict. In 1980, Iraq started an eight-year war with neighboring Iran. That prolonged battle left Iraq in dire economic straits. So Hussein borrowed money from his Arab neighbors, including Kuwait. When Kuwait began to call in those debts and pump oil from a disputed border field, Hussein responded by flexing his muscles, again.</item>
                     
                     <item> On 1990 Aug. 2, Iraqi troops crossed the border into Kuwait. "What was at work at that particular time was the fact that he's insulted by people who are not entitled to insult him," Aburish explains.</item>
                     
                     <item>So when he felt insulted by the Kuwaitis, Aburish says, he went in to teach them a lesson. "World politics overall, the reaction of the West, he didn't think of that one single bit," says Aburish. "His tribal mind superseded his modern mind in that case." In fact, Hussein's squabble with Kuwait triggered the world's largest military operation since World War II. In response to the Iraqi aggression, a military coalition of 34 countries was formed. The United States, Great Britain, France and Russia, with the crucial support of Arab nations like Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, drew up their forces in the deserts to the south and west of Iraq and Kuwait.</item>
                     
                     <item>The entire Middle East appeared to be at risk from Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. He had an active nuclear weapons program, hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles and an arsenal of chemical munitions.</item>
                     
                     <item>Plus, Iraq's military had used poison gas against the Iranians during the Iran-Iraq War (Iran also used chemical weapons during the conflict). Hussein has also used mustard gas against his own people in the Kurdish town of Halabja, where hundreds died. According to Physicians for Human Rights, trace elements of the nerve agent sarin were discovered after an assault on the village of Birjinni.</item>
                     
                     <item>As the Gulf War began, there was widespread fear that Hussein would try to escalate the conflict by using non-conventional weapons. Over the course of the war, more than 70 SCUD missiles would strike targets in Israel and the Gulf states. But in the end, Hussein never did launch, as many had feared he might, a non-conventional warhead.</item>
                     
                     <item>Nevertheless, the fears and suspicions of the international community did not go away after Iraq succumbed to Desert Storm. They led the United Nations Security Council to adopt Resolution 687, empowering a unique team of U.N. inspectors to destroy Iraq's capacity to use or make such weapons. The strict economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since the invasion of Kuwait were to remain in place until full compliance was assured.</item>
                     
                     <item>An international group of scientists, engineers and weapons specialists assembled to ensure Iraq complied with U.N. Security Council demands to disclose, destroy or render harmless all weapons of mass destruction.</item>
                     
                     <item>The team was called the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).</item>
                     
                     <item>In 1991, the first UNSCOM weapons inspectors began work in Iraq. Former U.S. Marine intelligence specialist Scott Ritter was one of them.</item>
                     
                     <item>"The inspection I was involved in was a no-notice, intrusive, on-site inspection, designed to uncover evidence of how Iraq was hiding their weapons," explains Ritter. "We didn't expect them to cooperate. We knew it would be confrontational."</item>
                     
                     <item>Ritter adds, "But we're like the proverbial camel. Once you let her nose in under the tent, we're coming in. You're not going to stop us. And once the Iraqis started admitting a lie, we were on them." </item>
                     
                     <item>UNSCOM's detective work revealed indisputable evidence of both chemical and biological weapons.</item>
                     
                     <item>As the U.N. inspectors worked alongside their Iraqi counterparts, the level of cooperation and tolerance varied.</item>
                     
                     <item>But by 1993, at the chemical weapons decommissioning site of Al-Muthana, the very scientists who had overseen the manufacture of Hussein's chemical weapons were overseeing their destruction. </item>
                     
                     <item>Thousands of artillery shells loaded with toxic chemicals, as well as tons of bombs and rockets, went up in smoke.</item>
                     
                     <item>Perhaps the most accepted measure of UNSCOM's success is the fact that it destroyed more of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction than were eliminated by the combined forces of Desert Storm. Despite all the progress being made, however, the weapons inspectors knew they were at work on a giant jigsaw puzzle and that many of the key pieces were still missing.</item>
                     
                     <item>"We [had] come to an interesting problem. Because the Iraqis didn't fully cooperate from the beginning, there's always going to be this level of mistrust," says Ritter. "UNSCOM's never going to fully believe what the Iraqis are putting on the table."</item>
                     
                     <item>The UNSCOM team became convinced that Iraq was still concealing parts of its arsenal. Iraq strenuously denied the accusations.</item>
                     
                     <item>When UNSCOM did eventually find its smoking gun, it came from a most unexpected source: the family of President Saddam Hussein. </item>
                     
                     <item>In 1995 Aug., Saddam Hussein's two sons-in-law - together with his daughters - defected. One of them, Hussein Kamel, had been in charge of Iraq's secret weapons concealment operations. He started to reveal the inner workings of the Iraqi armaments program as soon as he arrived in Jordan.</item>
                     
                     <item>"We were ordered to hide everything from the beginning. And indeed a lot of information was hidden and many files were destroyed in the nuclear chemical and biological programs," Kamel told CNN after his defection.</item>
                     
                     <item>"These were not individual acts of concealment, but they were the result of direct orders from the Iraqi head of state." </item>
                     
                     <item>Baghdad moved quickly to defuse the situation. They turned over a hoard of documents, claiming that Kamel had stashed them away on a chicken farm, without the authority of the leadership. The boxes contained a treasure trove of information on every aspect of Iraq's weapons programs.</item>
                     
                     <item>"It is generally believed that the Iraqi government feared that he would reveal a number of things from Jordan and that they decided that they would preempt this, that they would discover the files in the chicken farm and place the blame on him," explains Dr. Hans Blix, executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring and Verification Commission.</item>
                     
                     <item>UNSCOM now had a detailed roadmap of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons concealment program.</item>
                     
                     <item>After the disclosures, Kamel hoped he would find a new life outside Iraq. But Kamel's hope turned to despair. After weeks languishing in Jordan as guests of the late King Hussein, the two brothers allowed themselves to be lured back home with promises of mercy. It was a fatal mistake. They died in a shootout in Baghdad. The incident was later described in Iraq as a family matter. </item>

                     <item>Charts Saddam Hussein's rise to power and discusses his political opportunism, the atrocities committed by his government, and the invasion of Kuwait. Begins with the footage from the first day of the invasion of Kuwait dated 1990 Feb. 8, quite extensive amateur footage. Includes stock historical footage from early Iraqi history, including the colonial involvement of America and Britain, includes shots of Al-Qassem and other figures in the early nationalist history of Iraq and details Saddam's rise to power. Also tells the story of the takeover of the Ba'ath party after the 67 war against Israel and the rise of Colonel Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. Footage of al-Bakr meeting with Soviet leaders and Saddam meeting with other world leaders, shots of Saddam with Tito and Franco, as well as Hafez al-Assad. Also details the events of the First Gulf War between Iraq and Iran, shots of soldiers with gas masks and footage of soldiers who had undergone exposure to chemical weapons. Includes details of the shipping in the Gulf and the Farzad Bazoft case in which a British journalist was put to death for spying, as well as Saddam's attempts to smuggle nuclear triggers and the infamous super gun. Also included the lead up to the Kuwaiti invasion and the Gulf War. </item>
                     
                     <item>His name means "one who confronts." With his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has lived up to this moniker, earning Iraq the condemnation of the rest of the civilized world and prompting oil-importing nations and OPEC members alike to prepare for war. This visual biography charts Hussein's bloody but inexorable rise to power, his penchant for calculated atrocities and the shrewd opportunism that has made him such a menace to world stability.</item>

                     <item>Archival footage of Kurdish guerilla fighters in the field and training with Kurdish music in the background. Documentary describes the situation of the Kurdish people, as the largest people in the world without a nation of their own, with their land divided among other Middle Eastern countries who constantly destroyed Kurdish villages and stole Kurdish land. The film describes the break up of the Ottoman Empire, with archival footage, and the division of Kurdistan. Tells the story of the British destruction of the Kurdish Independent Administration in the 1920's headed by Sheikh Mahmoud. It describes the constant oppression and need for liberation movements in the Kurdish areas because of their lack of cultural and national independence. Describes Kurdistan as being colonies of the countries that they live under. There is a part of the film that shows Kurds working on the land, etc. with a poem recited in the background describing their oppression by the rulers of the countries they live under. The film also shows Kurdish peasants at work and this footage is combined with background voice describing the need for liberation and the plight of the peasant in decidedly Marxist revolutionary tones. Includes footage of Baghdad and the history of Iraq and the Kurds with images of General Qassem and discussion of his, at first favorable, policy towards the Kurds. Includes footage of Mollah Mustapha Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the Kurdish Democratic Party. Also includes the history of the Kurdish situation in the 1970s with the rise to power of Saddam Hussein. Includes interviews with Kurdish revolutionaries. Film continues with archival images of Kurdish peshmergas, guerilla fighters in the field, with patriotic songs in the background. Also, biography of Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish national movement and the KDP. Includes history of American involvement in military aid through Iran during the mid-seventies with Kissinger as well as aid by the Shah of Iran. Includes shots of Mahmoud Othman, KDP. The film describes clashes within the KDP, criticising by Mahmoud Othman of control of KDP by the Barzani family. His faction is the Preparatory Committee of the KDP. This is an attempt to reorganize the KDP in 1978 also in alignment with the Socialist Movement faction. The two groups merged to form the United Socialist party of Kurdistan. Also describes the PUK as the most important guerilla movement and Jalal Talabani as one of the main opposition to the Barzani family. Includes speeches to peshmerga describing their duties to the people of Kurdistan. Footage of Ali Askari giving an interview. End of film describes human rights abuses by the regime of Iraq against the Kurds and includes shots of executed people and demonstrations and checkpoints.</item>

                     <item>French program about the situation of the Kurds in Diyarbakir, Turkey and the deputy of the parliament Leyla Zana, dating from 1993 before she was put in jail. Zana is interviewed about the situation and takes the crew to interview villagers about the attacks on them by the Turkish security forces. Villagers describe kidnappings and house burning and other human rights abuses committed by the Turkish security forces. Evidence of Turkish grenades, etc. are found at the scene and the villagers say that the government gives them no assistance nor does it investigate or acknowledge the actions of the security forces nor do they guarantee the security of the Kurdish villagers.</item>
