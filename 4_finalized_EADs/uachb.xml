               <p>This scrapbook contains autograph pages, photographs, clippings, and memorabilia from Brown's extracurricular life at Trinity College from 1920-1921. The major subjects of the photographs are Trinity athletics/athletes (football, baseball, basketball, track and tennis), student life (including a section on Trinity women), the May Day Festival and scenery (including what appears to be a mill). Some of the photographs are identified.  The clippings relate to athletics events, the Debating Club, visiting speakers, campus incidents and cultural trends, and North Carolina political news.  One clipping reports a serious hazing incident in which a student was stabbed.  The final page includes a miniature wooden doll, labeled "Virginia Hicks," a Class of 1925 Trinity College student.  Pages were placed in archival folders, and loose items in envelopes for preservation. Arranged approximately by date (in original page order).</p>
