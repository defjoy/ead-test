         <p>Charlotte S. Holt (1914-1990) worked for forty years as a medical illustrator, sculptor, and exhibit designer. Together with her professional partner Dr. Frederick Falls, head of the OB/GYN department at the University of Illinois, Holt created thirty-six major medical exhibits for the education of physicians and surgeons. Holt's illustrations focus on gynecological and obstetric cases, and her bas relief sculptures show the diseases and conditions most frequently fatal to mothers and babies. Holt and Falls also produced a medical atlas, entitled <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Atlas of Obstetric Complications</title> (1961). </p>
