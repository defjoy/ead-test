         <abstract>Robert E. Lee was a Virginia-born career
        military officer, Confederate general in the U.S. Civil War, and president of what is now
        Washington and Lee University. Family and military correspondence of Robert E. Lee
        (1807-1870), Confederate general-in-chief; and of his descendants; and a few letters of
        Francis Lightfoot Lee, Richard Henry Lee, Henry Lee, and Mary Ann Randolph (Custis) Lee. The
        letters deal with many phases of Robert E. Lee's life from his marriage in 1832 until his
        death, including family and personal affairs, especially in his letters to a cousin, Mrs.
        Anna M. Fitzhugh; settlement of the Custis estate; and improvements at the family house in
        Arlington, Virginia. Included also is one volume of 295 telegram dispatches sent by Robert
        E. Lee from the field to Jefferson Davis and the Confederate War Department; two scrapbooks
        memorializing Robert E. Lee; a small notebook in Robert E. Lee's hand, 1857-1860, containing
        amounts of meat purchased for the Arlington household; and a letterpress book of Robert E.
        Lee III, a lawyer of Washington, D.C.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Family and military correspondence of Robert E. Lee (1807-1870), Confederate
        general-in-chief; and of his descendants; and a few letters of Francis Lightfoot Lee,
        Richard Henry Lee, Henry Lee, and Mary Ann Randolph (Custis) Lee. The letters deal with many
        phases of Robert E. Lee's life from his marriage in 1832 until his death, including family
        and personal affairs, especially in his letters to a cousin, Mrs. Anna M. Fitzhugh;
        settlement of the Custis estate; and improvements at the family house in Arlington,
        Virginia. During the Civil War the correspondence consists of official and family letters,
        the former containing much information on military activities. The postwar letters reveal
        details of domestic arrangements following the family's removal to Lexington, Virginia.</p>
         
         <p>One volume contains 295 telegrams (collected and arranged by C.C. Jones, Jr., and published
        by D.S. Freeman, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Lee's Dispatches</title>, New York, 1915) sent by
        Lee from the field to Jefferson Davis and the Confederate War Department, many having been
        endorsed by James A. Seddon. These dispatches relate to troop movements, reports of the
        intelligence service, skirmishes, enemy activities, transportation of prisoners and wounded
        men, and other details of military operations. Included also are two scrapbooks
        memorializing Robert E. Lee, chiefly consisting of clippings and engravings; a small
        notebook in Robert E. Lee's hand, 1857-1860, containing amounts of meat purchased for the
        Arlington household; and a letterpress book of Robert E. Lee III, a lawyer of Washington,
        D.C. </p>
