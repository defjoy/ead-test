         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Max Belcher was born in Philadelphia in 1944 to a black American father from North Carolina and a Jewish American mother of Polish/Lithuanian descent, born in rural Pennsylvania. In 1952 his father went to the Gold Coast at the invitation of the couple's wartime friend, Kwame Nkrumah, for what was scheduled to be an eight-week business trip. (His father was to remain in Africa for the next four decades.) By 1954, Belcher, Sr. had established himself in neighboring Liberia and had become a naturalized Liberian citizen; Max and his mother and sister then joined him.  At sixteen, Belcher began working in broadcasting as a staff announcer for the Liberian Broadcasting Corporation.  By the time he left to go to school in the U.S. in 1964, his lived experience in Liberia, French Guinea and Sierra Leone, combined with his growing appreciation of the capacity of radio, television and film to inform and influence, made him aware of the need for the material and techniques required to disseminate practical information in a developing country, particularly on matters of public health, agricultural practice, child rearing, and road safety.</p>
         
         <p>Belcher's plans were quickly thwarted by the escalation of the Vietnam War.  Feeling that the draft was inevitable, Belcher enlisted in the U.S. Marines, serving as a radio and television broadcaster in the U.S. and at Armed Forces Radio and Television Service on Okinawa; and as a Marine Corps Combat Correspondent in Vietnam.  After his tour of duty he settled in New York City, where he took a full-time job as a production assistant at NBC News and enrolled in college.  He began his studies at Columbia University in 1968 but quickly transferred to the New School for Social Research, where a filmmaking instructor encouraged him to grow accustomed to seeing the world through the lens of a still camera.  That training, initially intended to develop his skills as a filmmaker, introduced Belcher to the expressive potential of photography.  Continuing his liberal arts studies at the New School, he also enrolled in a photography class at the School of Visual Arts.  At the same time he began shooting experimental photographs in and around New York City, often choosing friends, landscapes and local architecture as his subjects.  Finishing his studies in 1970, he returned to Liberia in 1971, embarking on what would become his first major project as a professional photographer.</p>
         
         <p>Since that time, Belcher has developed into one of the nation's premiere living photographers.  His photographic interests in portraiture and vernacular architecture have developed in conjunction with the thematic exploration of racial identity, emigration and history that run through his work in Africa, Asia, North America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean.  He has had numerous one-man shows in the eastern United States and has contributed to group exhibits group exhibits across the U.S. and in Canada, Italy, Chile, Vietnam, and Soviet Armenia.  Belcher's photography is held both by private collectors and in the permanent collections of galleries and museums in the United States, Canada, and Vietnam.  He has received major support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Fulbright Scholars Program, the LEF Foundation, Massachusetts Cultural Council, the Kenan Charitable Trust, and programs of the National Endowment for the Arts.  His publications include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">House and Home: Spirits of the South</title> (1994), and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian Folk Architecture</title> (1988), both held by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.  He has also taught black-and-white photography to beginning, intermediate and advanced students in Massachusetts, and has lectured on his work.  He currently resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The photographs and printed materials in this collection date from 1969 to 1998, and document the work of Max Belcher, American-born photographer. The collection is organized into two series: <emph render="bold">Printed Materials</emph> and <emph render="bold">Photography.</emph>  The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> consists of publicity, exhibit literature, and other materials related to Belcher's work as a photographer.  The much larger <emph render="bold">Photography Series</emph> includes 1,027 contact sheets (860 black-and-white, 167 color), 381 photographs (239 black-and-white, 142 color), and five color fine prints spanning nearly three decades of Belcher's professional work as a photographer.  This series is divided into eleven project-based subseries, which have been arranged chronologically by the start date of each project.  Within each subseries, contact sheets precede photographs,and black-and-white work precedes color.  Individual items in the photography series bear specific technical and identifying information, usually marked by Belcher on the backs of contact sheets and photographs.  Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts.</p>

               <p>The photography in this collection represents Belcher's work from his first forays into photography in New York City between <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1969</unitdate> and <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1971</unitdate>, up to his most recent projects in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and the United States.  This series is organized by project subseries, which are arranged chronologically by the beginning date of each project.  Within each subseries, black-and-white work precedes color work, and contact sheets precede photographs.  Subseries descriptions describing collection holdings for each project follow the restrictions note below. For information about specific contact sheets and photographs, researchers are advised to consult Belcher's own notes on his work, usually found on the back of individual contact sheets or photographs.</p>

                  <p>This body of work explores the relationships between migration, identity and history in the American Liberian experience. Belcher's interest in this topic derived from his upbringing as a Philadelphia-born American who was raised in Liberia for ten years beginning in 1954.  The subseries includes 210 black-and-white contact sheets, 89 black-and-white photographs, 22 color contact sheets and 10 color photographs.  The earliest work, completed between 1971 and 1973, represents some of Belcher's first professional work as a photographer.  There is also additional fieldwork done in the years 1977-1978 and 1982-1983, featuring American Liberian architecture and portraiture of indigenous Liberians and American Liberians.  The exhibit catalog, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian Folk Architecture,</title> available in the Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, provides more information about these projects.</p>
                  
                  <p>Belcher's subsequent work on Southern architecture (located in a separate subseries) took him back to the origins of Liberian architecture in the vernacular architecture of the American South.  These examples of cultural memory and historical continuity are discussed in both <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered</title>  and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">House and Home: Spirits of the South,</title> also held by the Rubenstein Library. Belcher returned to the themes of migration, identity and history in his later work in Saman&#225;, Dominican Republic  (also located in a separate subseries). </p>

                  <p>The 165 contact sheets and 21 photographs in this subseries, all in black-and-white, include experimental shots documenting Belcher's early and continuing work with various grades and makes of film, paper and photographic equipment.  The images document a range of Belcher's photographic improvisations and studies, as well as attempts at capturing various textures, scapes, and light; and at composing with different angles and in varied photographic settings.  Thus, the subseries documents the development of Belcher's photographic signature and style.  The images include portraiture, architecture, landscapes and cityscapes, and were shot in Massachusetts, Florida, and Michigan.

                     <p>The Massachusetts Council on the Arts sponsored Belcher's work as artist-in-residence from 1979-1981 at the Washington Community School in Lynn.  The images taken by Belcher primarily consist of portraits of elementary- and upper-school students, with a handful of shots of architecture, landscapes and other subject matter.  The subseries includes 80 black-and-white contact sheets, nine black-and-white photographs and one color contact sheet.</p>

                  <p>These images of vernacular architecture in New Brunswick and  Quebec, Canada were taken during two trips in June and August 1990, supported by a Summer Research Grant from the Kenan Charitable Trust at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, where Belcher taught.  Materials consist of seven black-and-white contact sheets, one black-and-white photograph, 18 color contact sheets, and six color photographs.</p>

                  <p>Returning to the major themes of Belcher's earlier work in Liberia , this work explores the relationships between migration, identity and history by documenting African American emigration to and life in Saman&#225;, Dominican Republic.  Specifically, the photographs portray the descendants of U.S. slave- and free-born blacks who emigrated from Philadelphia to Saman&#225; in 1824 and 1825 as part of a migration organized by the Haitian Emigration Society.  For a fuller description of this project, see Belcher's one-page description of his work in Saman&#225;, included in the printed materials series. The subseries includes 51 black-and-white contact sheets, 4 black-and-white photographs, 96 color contact sheets, 98 color photographs, and 5 exhibition-quality, fine color prints. </p>
