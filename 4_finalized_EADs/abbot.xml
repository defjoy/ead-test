         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of the 
		  Abbot family consist mainly of correspondence, but
		  also include financial and legal papers, 
		  diaries, a 
		  letter-book, clippings, printed material,
		  speeches and photographs (several of them 
		  cartes-de-visite). The papers date from 1733 to
		  1999, the bulk ranging from 1860-1910. A significant portion of the
		  correspondence comprises personal letters exchanged during the 
		  Civil War between 
		  William Richardson Abbot, who became headmaster of
		  Bellevue High School in Virginia, and his wife, 
		  Lucy Minor Abbot (daughter of educator Dr. Charles
		  Minor and niece of prominent legal scholar John Minor). Abbot's letters mention
		  battles and political events of the Civil War. They also recount Abbot's
		  experience of active service in the field as an officer in the 
		  First Regiment of the Engineers Troops (Army of
			 Virginia). Other correspondence from the nineteenth century includes
		  exchanges between 
		  W.R. Abbot and his immediate family, both during
		  and after the Civil War, as well as numerous letters to Abbot from parents of
		  boys attending 
		  Bellevue High School. The collection also includes
		  materials from the lives of the children and grandchildren of William and Lucy
		  Abbot, ranging from the late-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.
		  Letters from the children of William and Lucy Abbot consist of personal
		  exchanges, including accounts of extended tours through and stays in
		  turn-of-the-century Europe, as well as experiences of higher study in the 
		  German university system of the time. The Abbot
		  family papers also extend to materials belonging to the Minors of
		  Charlottesville (Va.), and include correspondence of 
		  Charles and John Minor. The Abbot Family papers
		  are particularly rich in their documentation of military and civilian life
		  during the Civil War; 
		  boys' secondary education in the liberal arts during
		  Reconstruction; and the romantic and social conventions of the American South
		  in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes Abbot's
		  personal letters to his wife and family (William Richardson Abbot and Lucy
		  Ridgway Minor Abbot sub-series), as well as several from his mother and sisters
		  (Abbot Family (1) sub-series). Correspondence from the Civil War consists
		  predominantly of Abbot's romantic exchanges with Lucy Minor. Apart from
		  expressing Abbot's deep attachment to Lucy, both during and immediately after
		  their courtship, the letters document Abbot's daily life as a clerk in the 
		  War Office in Richmond, his duties as an officer on
		  recruiting assignments in Georgia and his experiences in the field in Virginia.
		  Abbot's letters from 1864-1865 describe conditions at various camps and picket
		  lines in and around 
		  Appomattox, where Abbot was present during General
		  Lee's surrender. </p>
         
         <p>The letters of Abbot's widowed mother and sisters speak to women's
		  experiences of everyday life during the War. The Abbot women sometimes mention
		  the price of supplies and clothing from both before and after the Civil War. Of
		  particular interest is an exceptionally detailed, ten-paged letter from 
		  Ellen Abbot to her brother from September of 1864,
		  recounting the surrender of the town of 
		  Woodstock in Northern Virginia to Union soldiers.
		  Written over the course of several days, the letter describes Ellen and her
		  mother's departure from the border town, providing a general idea of refugee
		  movements within and around the state. The account details the prices of
		  supplies and of means of conveyance during evacuation. Ellen Abbot also
		  documented the concealment and care of wounded Confederate soldiers by
		  civilians, partisan violence, and a summary execution during the town's
		  surrender. </p>
         
         <p>A significant portion of nineteenth century material from the Abbot
		  Family Correspondence series relates to Abbot's teaching activities after the
		  War, and in particular to his involvement with and eventual purchase of
		  Bellevue High School (1870-1909) (Education/Bellevue sub-series). Founded by
		  prominent educator and lawyer J.P. Holcombe in 1866, this institution was an
		  important preparatory school for the University of Virginia. A series of
		  letters from parents of its students provide personalized accounts of education
		  during the Reconstruction. Of interest is a two-paged letter from one of
		  Abbot's students in Mississippi (1874), assessing the political and social
		  causes of interracial violence in his hometown during the Reconstruction. </p>
         
         <p>Early to mid-twentieth century material from the Correspondence series
		  consists of exchanges between the children and grandchildren of William and
		  Lucy Minor. (Abbot Family (2) subseries). The letters of 
		  Francis H. Abbot, son of W.R and Lucy Abbot, are
		  predominantly reports of his experience as a doctoral student of German
		  language and literature in the Universities of Goettingen and Leipzig
		  (1889-1903). A few political lampoons on 
		  postcards provide a perspective on current
		  events in Europe at the time, including perceptions of 
		  Prussian militarism and of events leading to the 
		  Boer war. Also included in this subseries are
		  personal correspondence of 
		  James Southall (married Jane Oliver Abbot),
		  prominent physicist at the University of Columbia; personal and business
		  letters of 
		  Daniel Henderson (married Lucy Minor Abbot),
		  lawyer and well-known activist for Native-American rights; early personal
		  correspondence of 
		  Virginia Henderson (daughter of Daniel and Lucy
		  Henderson), pioneer in the post-war nursing profession and coauthor of the
		  authoritative study on modern nursing techniques, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Nursing Research: Survey and Assessment. </title>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence series extends to the Minor side of the family ( 
		  Minor Family subseries), and includes letters from
		  the early-nineteenth century exchanged between 
		  Dr. Charles Minor, prominent educator in Virginia,
		  and his brother 
		  John Minor, leading legal scholar at the
		  University of Virginia. Correspondence of the Minor brothers continued in
		  exchanges with Abbot during the latter's tenure at Brookhill School before the
		  Civil War, and afterwards, when Abbot served as principal of Bellevue. The
		  subseries also includes some of the private correspondence of the numerous
		  siblings of Lucy Ridgway Minor. </p>
         
         <p>While the bulk of the collection comprises correspondence, the papers
		  also include Abbot's addresses to schools and the Virginia Educational Society;
		  printed bulletins detailing courses of study and formal statements of the
		  teaching philosophy at Bellevue; and an official letter-book, receipts,
		  financial and legal documents relating to the purchase, expansion and daily
		  administration of the school. Other materials relating to the children of the
		  William and Lucy Abbot include educational addresses by their son, 
		  Charles Minor Abbot, who administered Bellevue
		  until it closed (1901-1909), as well as biographical material on Virginia
		  Henderson's authoritative influence on professional nursing. </p>
         
         <p>Newspaper clippings from the Reconstruction include articles by 
		  Ellen Abbot (Sr.) on her interpretation of the
		  events leading immediately to the Civil War, and by 
		  William R. Abbot on the role of women in the
		  Confederate cause. These also include some patriotic poetry; Virginian novelist
		  
		  Thomas Nelson Page's childhood recollection of a
		  slave-auction; reports of speeches by W.R. Abbot; and obituaries of friends and
		  family.</p>
         
         <p>Of particular interest from the Minor side of the family papers are
		  two personal 
		  diaries, the first belonging to 
		  Dr. Charles Minor and the second kept by 
		  Anne Minor, the youngest of the ten children of
		  Charles Minor. Charles Minor's eleven-paged account of a trip from
		  Charlottesville to New Orleans provides a detailed idea of road and steamboat 
		  travel in the early nineteenth century. The account
		  mentions 
		  General Jackson, who was on the same boat. The
		  second half of the diary is an autobiographical note on Minor's early
		  instruction in the classics. The ten-page record of Anne Minor's diary is
		  unusual for its dramatic reconstruction of a child's perspective on events
		  witnessed during the Civil War, as well as for its disturbing reflections on
		  the particular insecurities suffered by young children in war-time (c.1929).
		  </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Picture Series</emph> includes 
		  photographs and several 
		  cartes-de-visite of the Abbot and Minor
		  families.</p>
         
         <p>The Abbot Family Papers provide the researcher with numerous vantage
		  points onto public, professional and private life in 
		  nineteenth-century Virginia, most particularly
		  through personalized accounts of men and women of the time. While the papers
		  follow the families' colonial past from the early eighteenth century into the
		  mid-twentieth century, the collection is noteworthy for its emphasis on
		  military and private life in the Confederacy and in the Reconstruction South.
		  The collection illuminates the experience of the Civil War through numerous
		  windows onto the private lives of individuals; the professionalization of
		  secondary education during the Reconstruction; the social and epistolary
		  conventions of nineteenth century courtship; and the construction of an
		  inter-generational identity, based on extended familial affections and ties to
		  the institution of Bellevue. </p>
