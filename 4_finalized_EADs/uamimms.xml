            <p>Orphaned at an early age, Christine Mimms was raised by her mother's sister in Scotland County, North Carolina.  After graduating from Gibson High School, she attended Meredith College where she was active in government and the debating society.  She received her business training at Kings Business College in Raleigh.  She moved to Durham in 1935 when she was hired as a secretary.  Mimms served as secretary/executive assistant to six Duke Presidents, from President William Few to President Terry Sanford.  She married S. C. Mimms in 1966 and was an active member of the Watts Street Baptist Church. She helped organize both the Durham Theater Guild and the Allied Arts and was a member of the arts society's original board of directors.  She retired from Duke in 1977.  Mimms died in 1990.</p>
