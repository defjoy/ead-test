         <p>"Pee Wee" (Numa Smith) Moore was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 5, 1928. After attending Washington High School in Raleigh and Hampton College in Virginia, Moore began performing professionally as a baritone saxophonist in the early 1950s.  He played with such artists as Lucky Millinder, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Mary Lou Williams, Bill Doggett, and Rich Hargrove. While Moore resided in New York for much of his professional career, he eventually returned to Raleigh, where he performed regularly as a saxophonist throughout the 1980s and beyond. Moore passed away due to complications from pancreatic cancer on April 13, 2009.</p>

               <p>Clippings include newspaper articles about Moore's life and career as a jazz musician. One folder is devoted entirely to clippings related to Moore's time performing with Louis Jordan, and another folder contains photocopies of materials from a notebook of personal contacts compiled by Moore. This series also includes several programs from Moore's performances in the Raleigh, NC area during the 1990s along with programs from Moore's commencement ceremony at Wake Technical Institute and programs from Moore's funeral. One folder primarily contains manuscript drafts of jazz lead sheets presumably written by Moore along with a small amount of published music by other composers. Miscellaneous items include Moore's certificates from Wake Technical Institute, documents concerning the repairs of Moore's home in Raleigh, NC, a calendar featuring Moore on the cover, and the plaque from Moore's funeral.
