         <abstract>In 1938, the School of Forestry at Duke was founded as the first graduate school of forestry in the South.

Collection contains memoranda, brochures, newspaper clippings, conference materials, annual reports, photographs and slides relating to the Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies from roughly 1960 through 1979.</abstract>

            <p>Instruction in Forestry was offered to Trinity College students as early as 1932.  In 1938, the School of Forestry was founded as the first graduate school of forestry in the South.  In the 1970s, the school expanded its program to include a broad range of resource and environmental studies.  In 1974/75, it became the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.  In 1991, the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Duke University Marine Lab came together to become the School of Environment. In 1995, following a $20 million gift from Peter M. and Ginny Nicholas of Boston, the name changed to the Nicholas School of the Environment.  In 1997, the Department of Geology joined the School, bringing with it new resources and a new name in December 2000, the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences.</p>
