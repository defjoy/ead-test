         <abstract>Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. was a cigar manufacturing company located in Suffield, Connecticut, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Collection of ledgers, account books, order forms, and other ephemera relating to the sale and purchase of cigars by Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co., Cigar Manufacturers. Materials range in date from the 1870s through the early 1900s, and it is believed that the cigar company may have changed names throughout that period. The centerpiece of the collection is a specimen book of sample cigar box labels, created by the lithographers Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer around 1878. The specimen book includes about 115 leaves, with labels affixed on each side of the leaf; the label colors range from two colors to multiple colors per label. Account books document cigar production, purchase, and sales information. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising &amp; Marketing History.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. was a cigar manufacturing company located in Suffield, Connecticut, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Suffield was the site of the country's first cigar factory, which opened in 1810 after its owners hired a Cuban to teach its workers how to roll tobacco. The town became home to numerous factories that used local crops and sold a variety of cigars throughout the eastern United States. Not much is known about Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. in particular, but its involvement in cigar manufacturing and selling appear to reflect the general activities of Suffield cigar factories during this time.</p>
         
         <p>Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer was a lithography company that created box labels for cigar manufacturers to paste on the inside lid of a box of cigars. Sample books like the one in this collection were distributed to local cigar manufacturers, who could then order the labels by their designated number. Frederick Heppenheimer, from New York City, was one of the earliest and most prolific commerical lithographers. He later partnered with Louis Maurer, another well-regarded artist, to create Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer in 1872. Maurer was one of the few cigar label lithographers who regularly signed his work. The company was one of dozens of lithography companies from this period whose art reflected everyday life in the United States.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

               <p>Specimen book created by Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer, dated approximately 1878, and distributed to Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. Book contains about 120 pages with labels pasted on each side of each page. Each label has a four-digit number stamped in blue ink, ranging from the 1600s to the 7000s. The labels are not in numerical order. The book and its pages are in fair condition; the book's binding needs preservation work, the back cover is detached, and some pages are dirty. The labels' lithographs are in excellent condition, many with vibrant colors. The artwork is generally very bright with subjects tending towards an exotic or tropical feel.</p>
