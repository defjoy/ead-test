         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The University Committee on Long Range Planning
		  was formed in 1958 under President A. Hollis Edens. The
		  function according to a letter approving the committee was
		  <emph render="doublequote">to give appropriate consideration to
		  matters of educational programming and policy where
		  institutional planning and advancement are
		  concerned.</emph> The Committee at first dealt with issues
		  dealing with academic life, faculty development, and the
		  development of the quality of students and intellectual
		  life through admissions and enrollment. During the
		  Committee's initial academic year it authorized eleven
		  subcommittees which dealt with the Graduate School, Social
		  Sciences, Duke Press, Research Libraries, Science and
		  Mathematics, Religion, Undergraduate Colleges, the
		  University Arts Center, the Institute of Contemporary
		  Literature, Foreign Student Programs, and the Humanities.
		  The committee issued its first report,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Planning and Development at
		  Duke University,</title> in June of 1959.</p>
         
         <p>The Committee's first chairman was Paul M. Gross,
		  the Vice President for Education and Dean of the
		  University. However, on March 23, 1960 in the wake of an
		  administrative crisis known as
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">the Gross-Edens Affair</title>
		the Board of Trustees stripped Dr. Gross of his committee
		chairmanship and other administrative posts. Vice-Chairman
		Marcus Hobbs was named to succeed him, but Hobbs tendered
		his resignation on March 28, 1960. Hobbs was in turn
		succeeded by Joseph E. Markee, another member of the
		committee. These events brought the future of the planning
		process into question. The committee informed the
		University's faculty and staff that it was in
		<emph render="doublequote">complete and total disagreement with
		the action taken by the Board of Trustees at its meeting on
		March 23, 1960 in removing Dr. Paul M. Gross as a member
		and the Chairman of the Long Range Planning
		Committee.</emph> In its second Progress Report, (May,
		1960) the committee stated that they felt it best to
		suspend activities <emph render="doublequote">until such time as
		it receive[d] from the Board of Trustees and from the
		President of the University a satisfactory expression of
		their approval of the planning operation as it has been
		carried on</emph> (page 73). If approval was given, the
		committee recommended that the University extend the
		committee's charge until June 1961 and provide a budget to
		fund it through that period. </p>
         
         <p>This was done; the committee's third progress
		  report,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Duke University in the Decade
		  Ahead,</title> was issued in June 1961. It dealt with
		enrollment projections, personnel and facility
		requirements, and financial projections. The committee
		concluded that systematic planning was
		<emph render="doublequote">essential</emph> and that
		<emph render="doublequote">its function should be
		institutionalized so as to achieve continuity and wide
		participation throughout the University</emph> (pages
		53-54). In 1962, the University Committee on Long Range
		Planning was reconstituted as the University Planning
		Committee and assumed a stronger role in the University.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The collection consists of records relating to the
		  Committee on Long Range Planning's involvement with
		  academic, faculty, and institutional development of the
		  University. Correspondence, memoranda, reports,
		  hand-written and typed minutes, clippings, pamphlets,
		  charts, projections, books, comprise this collection.
		  Materials range in date from 1958-1962. Although the
		  majority of the materials were created by the Committee,
		  some reference materials from other sources were collected
		  by the Committee in relation to its work, including
		  letters, reports, booklets and pamphlets about other
		  schools and programs. </p>
         
         <p>Major subjects include University and planning
		  administration, student life (dormitories, athletics, and
		  extracurricular activities), institutional development
		  (philosophical beginnings and practical implementations),
		  enrollment and admission (test data, alumni involvement,
		  prediction equations and geographical distribution) and
		  academic/intellectual life (graduate and undergraduate
		  schools and departments, curriculum information and
		  planning and faculty development).</p>
         
         <p>This collection is divided into six (6) series:
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Minutes and Agendas</ref>,
		  1958-1962;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Meeting Files</ref>, 1959-1961;
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Correspondence</ref>, 1958-1962;

		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Reference Materials</ref>,
		  1958-1962; and
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Subcommittees and
			 Committees</ref>, 1958-1962.</p>
         
         <p> The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1">Minutes and Agendas</ref>
		  [1958-1962] series includes minutes, agendas, and
		  summaries, and it chronicles the development of planning at
		  the University.
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2">Meeting Files</ref> [1959-1961] is
		  arranged chronologically and includes memos, letters,
		  reports, booklets, bulletins, news clippings, and
		  statistical information specifically discussed at meetings
		  of the Committee. The materials in the meeting files, in
		  some cases, can be matched against the materials delineated
		  in the Committee minutes. The Committee met almost weekly
		  during the academic year, from 1958-1962. </p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3">Correspondence</ref> [1958-1962]
		  represents the wide range of issues faced by the Committee.
		  Primary correspondents consist of the President of the
		  University, the Provost, faculty and staff members of the
		  University, and expert professors and professionals from
		  other universities; these include R. Taylor Cole, Marcus E.
		  Hobbs, Paul M. Gross, A. Hollis Edens, Daryl J. Hart,
		  Richard L. Predmore, Frank DeVyver, and Alan K. Manchester.
		  </p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4">Reports and Recommendations</ref>
		  [1958-1962] series is arranged alphabetically. It includes
		  reports and recommendations from academic and non-academic
		  departments, graduate and professional schools, visiting
		  experts on academic programs and departments, and
		  University faculty and staff.
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5">Reference Materials</ref>
		  [1958-1962] are arranged alphabetically. These folders
		  contain reports, charts, pamphlets, and statistics
		  collected by the Committee for use during its work. </p>
         
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6">Subcommittees and Committees</ref>
		  [1958-1962] series is arranged topically. The Long Range
		  Planning Committee had a number of subcommittees, but this
		  series includes reports, recommendations, correspondence
		  and records of a few of these committees: the Committee on
		  the Undergraduate Colleges, 1959-1960; the Committee on
		  Faculty and Staff Improvement, 1960-1961; and the Committee
		  on Professional and Graduate School, 1958-1962. </p>
