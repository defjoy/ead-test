         <p>College president, Methodist clergyman and bishop,
		  born Laurens, South Carolina, July 22, 1861. A.M., Wofford
		  College, 1892; D.D., Randolph-Macon, Wofford, 1895; L.L.D.,
		  Tulane, 1910, Trinity, 1916. President, Trinity College,
		  Durham, NC, 1894-1910; Bishop, Methodist Episcopal Church,
		  South, 1910-1922. As an educator, Kilgo was an advocate of
		  a strong public school system, but thought that higher
		  education belonged in co-ed colleges conducted under
		  Christian auspices. </p>
         
         <p> Kilgo's father, James Tillman Kilgo, was a
		  circuit riding Methodist preacher, and his mother Catherine
		  Mason, of Fairfield County, S.C., was related to the
		  prominent Mason family of Virginia. There were five
		  children, three boys and two girls. John's early education
		  took place in those communities where his father preached.
		  He attended McArthur Academy in Limestone, and Gaffney
		  Seminary, and in 1880 enrolled at Wofford College. Eye
		  problems caused his withdrawal at the end of his sophomore
		  year. While at McArthur, a school organized along the lines
		  of a strict English academy, he absorbed the code of strict
		  rules and discipline that characterized his own career as
		  an educator. After withdrawing from Wofford, Kilgo taught
		  school in Clio, S.C., and was licensed to preach in May of
		  1882. From then until 1888, he rode a circuit in South
		  Carolina, becoming known as an outstanding preacher. In
		  December of 1882, he married Fannie Natt Turner, of
		  Gaffney, S.C.; they had five children. </p>
         
         <p> In 1888 he was made financial agent of Wofford
		  College, and was able to continue his education. He
		  received the M.A. from Wofford in 1892, and was appointed
		  Professor of Philosophy and Political Economy. It was
		  during his time at Wofford that he developed the
		  educational philosophy he was later to put into practice at
		  Trinity. Kilgo thought that true higher education could be
		  secured only in institutions conducted under Christian
		  auspices; such schools should be coeducational, as separate
		  women's colleges at that time tended to be inferior to
		  men's. </p>
         
         <p> In 1894, at the age of thirty-three, Kilgo was
		  elected a delegate to the General Conference of the
		  Methodist Episcopal Church, South, becoming one of the
		  youngest men ever sent. His reputation led an editor to to
		  call him "one of the most useful and popular members of the
		  South Carolina Conference." In July of that year, Kilgo was
		  elected President of Trinity College in Durham. He took up
		  his post the next month, establishing a reputation as a
		  gifted preacher and educator. Methodists around North
		  Carolina were ready to support their college and see it
		  grow, and it was during Kilgo's tenure that Washington Duke
		  took a great interest in the college's affairs. As
		  President, Kilgo spoke out on many controversial topics,
		  including the role of the state in education, academic
		  freedom, and the education of women. </p>
         
         <p> In 1910, he was elected a Bishop of the Methodist
		  Episcopal church, South, and resigned as President of
		  Trinity. He continued, however, to take an active role in
		  the affairs of the school, becoming first a member, then
		  the chairman, of the Board of Trustees. He lived in Durham
		  until 1915, when he moved to Charlotte in order to more
		  easily carry out his responsibilities as a bishop. In 1917,
		  following a controversy over student behavior, Kilgo
		  severed his connection with the College. Kilgo was a member
		  of the Education Commission of the Methodist Episcopal
		  Church, South, which founded and incorporated Emory
		  University. </p>
         
         <p> His health began to fail late in the decade, and
		  in 1920 he was relieved of his episcopal duties. On August
		  22, 1922, he died in Charlotte, and was buried there. </p>

		  Gattis against Kilgo, Benjamin N. Duke, and W. R. Odell.
		  The seven
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s8">Scrapbooks</ref> contain clippings
		  of Kilgo's articles and sermons, pages cut from the Bible
		  and hymnals, book reviews, and other items. The

               <p>This series consists of materials added to the
				collection that describe Kilgo's records and papers, as
				well as materials written about Kilgo and Trinity College.
				These materials include a card catalog of the library of
				President Kilgo, which was presented to Duke University
				Library, and an early card inventory of the Kilgo records
				and papers created by the Manuscripts Department. Also
				included are reference notes compiled by Nannie Tilley in
				1936, documenting the newspaper coverage (ca. 1891-ca.
				1906) of the Bassett and Gattis cases and the relationships
				between Kilgo, Trinity College, and the Duke family.</p>

                  <p>Kilgo's Library may have been presented to
				  Duke University sometime after 1924. The volumes in the
				  library were cataloged around 1946, and seem to have been
				  incorporated into both the Divinity School Library and the
				  general collection of the Duke University Libraries. Many
				  of the titles listed in the Kilgo Library card index can be
				  found in the Duke University Libraries online catalog.</p>

                  <p>These references to articles about Kilgo
				  were collected in 1936 by Nannie M. Tilley of the Duke
				  Manuscripts Department. The notes refer to articles written

				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Webster's

				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Progressive

				Subjects of the articles include the Bassett Affair and the

				slander suit. Many of these articles attack Kilgo and
				Trinity College for accepting trust money from the Duke
				family, while others defend the actions of Kilgo and the
