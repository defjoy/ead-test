         <abstract>William Atkinson was baptized on March 8, 1679. He appears to have been an amateur theologian or preacher in Great Britain. The collection consists of a handmade, leather-bound notebook that possibly belonged to William Atkinson. Compact handwriting fills all 96 pages plus the inside front and back covers with extracts taken from the works of contemporary theologians including John Tillotson's sermons, William Nichols's Defence of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England, and Richard Baxter's Now or Never; along with Atkinson's commentary on the extracts and potentially original theological reflections or sermons by him. The choice of extracts, the inclusion of entries on Quaker theology, and the nature of Atkinson's criticism suggest that he took a non-conformist stance against the Church of England. The notebook is undated, but refers to the year 1715 on page four.</abstract>
