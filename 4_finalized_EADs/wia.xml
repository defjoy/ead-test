         <abstract>Non-profit, inter-racial organization
                founded in Durham, N.C. in September 1968; Elna Spaulding was founder and first
                president. Collection comprises correspondence, by-laws, meeting
                agendas and minutes, budgets, articles of incorporation, as well as information
                about the organization's relationship to the Women In Action Foundation of Durham,
                N.C. Documents the organization's involvement in the Durham community on a variety
                of issues, including easing racial tensions; smoothing the way for court ordered
                school integration in 1970; providing for the recreational and cultural needs of
                disadvantaged youth; and establishing a clearinghouse to offer information and
                referral services to Durham citizens for a variety of social problems.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The beginnings of the WIAPVC can be traced to July 1968, when Elna (Mrs. Asa T.)
                Spaulding was invited to attend a forum in New York City sponsored by the McCall
                Corporation in which women from all over the United States were asked to discuss the
                topic <emph render="doublequote">What Women Can Do to End Violence in
                    America.</emph> Upon her return, Mrs. Spaulding founded Women-In-Action for the
                Prevention of Violence and its Causes, which was organized as an inter-racial,
                non-profit community organization. At the time WIAPVC was formed, Durham was in the
                midst of a black buying boycott, which was an effort on the part of blacks in the
                city to exert pressure on merchants to focus upon needs which they believed had been
                unmet. The new group was credited with helping open communication between the Black
                Solidarity Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Merchants Association during
                the boycott. The early history of the WIAPVC is best documented in the
                correspondence and administrative files series of this collection. As the
                organization grew, it involved itself in economic assistance, community
                improvements, education issues, referral services, addictions and rape counseling,
                prisoner rehabilitation, and race relations in general. The organization was still
                in existence as of 2010.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The records of Women-In-Action for the Prevention of Violence and Its Causes, Inc.
                (WIAPVC), an interracial community service non-profit organization based in Durham,
                North Carolina, span the years 1968 to 1998. Materials document the organization's
                history beginning with its foundation in 1968, and include correspondence, by-laws,
                meeting agendas and minutes, budgets, articles of incorporation, clippings,
                photographs, a scrapbook, awards, and other documentation of its activities and
                milestones. The records contain information about the organization's various
                projects and workshops, and its relationship with the Women In Action Foundation of
                Durham, N.C., Inc. Persons associated with the organization included business,
                political, and community leaders and activists, among them Ann Atwater, Mrs. William
                A. Clement, Mrs. James E. Davis, Dr. Juanita Kreps, Mrs. H.M. Michaux, Mrs. Kenneth
                C. Royall, Margaret Rose Sanford, Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, and Mrs. Albert
                Whiting. There are also letters of support from Senators B. Everett Jordan and Sam
                Erwin.</p>
         
         <p>The bulk of the early items in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Correspondence Series</ref>, dating from 1968 to 1969,
                reflects the tenacity and persistence on the part of Spaulding, the first president,
                in seeking money for the organization's activities. She sought funding from national
                and North Carolina foundations and local businesses. Among the contributors were the
                Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, the Grant Foundation, and the City of Durham. Money was
                also raised by dues paid by its members, which became a point of controversy for the
                organization.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Administrative Files</ref> include agendas and minutes for WIAPVC's general,
                board, executive, and advisory committees. Agendas and programs for general meetings
                indicate that the leaders in the organization attempted to maintain a balance
                between focusing on some aspect of the group itself (such as its by-laws and
                self-evaluation) and programs of community-wide importance. The advisory committee
                evolved from the steering committee and was made up of subcommittee chairs.</p>
         
         <p>Folders in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Subcommittees Series</ref> generally contain correspondence, reports, and
                guidelines. Records show that the number of subcommittees waxed and waned depending
                on the need for them. Subcommittees for which records exist include Civic
                Improvement, Education, Human Relations, and Police-Community Relations. The
                subcommittees undertook outreach and programs that were significant to Durham's
                community. </p>
         
         <p>The organization's outreach activities are also documented in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Conferences,
                    Workshops, and Projects series</ref>. Conferences and workshops sponsored by the
                organization reflect the group's efforts to improve itself, support other
                organizations, and reach out to provide service to the community. In the same
                series, WIAPVC projects indicate the wide range of interests and responsibilities
                which the organization sought to undertake. Among those represented in the files are
                the Center for School Support; the Clearinghouse, which offered information and
                referral services to Durham citizens for a variety of concerns; Cornwallis Housing
                Project, which helped provide recreational needs for youth residing in the project;
                the Cultural Experience Pilot Project, which allowed for 37 Durham junior high
                school students from low income families to spend three days in Washington; the
                Durham Emergency Energy Committee, which helped provide fuel to needy families in
                the Durham community; and various intern projects, in which students from the Duke
                Divinity School Field Education Program participated.</p>
         
         <p>The bulk of the processed collection consists of the early records of the WIAPVC.
                Later years (1980s-1990s) are represented in Accession 1996-0164 and Accession
                2008-0104, which include financial activities, projects, administrative files,
                reports, event planning information, newsletters, and awards ceremonies, and are
                minimally processed. </p>
