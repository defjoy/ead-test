         <p>The Edwin Peacock Papers span the dates 1915 to 1997, with the majority of the items dating from the 1940s to 1997, and provide many insights into the life and work of Carson McCullers through materials in three series: Correspondence, Photographs, and Printed Materials.

Many are from translators and biographers of McCullers (Virginia Carr, Jacques Tournier, and Robert Duparc). There is also significant correspondence by the author's husband, Reeves McCullers, and copies of letters to each other while Reeves served in the armed forces in France during World War II.</p>
         
         <p>The bulk of the <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> consists of black and white snapshots primarily from the 1940s and 1950s. The majority of them represent Carson McCullers, her friends and family, including Edwin Peacock, John Zeigler, Mary Mercer, her sister, and her mother.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials and Clippings Series</emph> consists of documents related to the work of Carson McCullers.

               <p>The bulk of the series consists of correspondence written to the bookstore owners Edwin Peacock and John Zeigler, although there are a few letters addressed to Zeigler's neighbor, Robert Holmes. Prominent correspondents are Carson McCullers and her husband Reeves, who wrote to each other nearly every day while Reeves served in the army during World War II. There is also significant correspondence from the biographers of McCullers, especially Virginia Carr, as well as Jacques Tournier and Robert Duparc. Other correspondence includes letters McCullers wrote to Peacock during her stay at Yadoo, letters from Reeves's friend, John Vincent Adams, and letters from the sister of McCullers, Margarita Smith. Topics relate primarily to McCullers's work and to personal matters. Folders in the series are arranged alphabetically; items within folders are in chronological order.</p>

               <p>Contains 62 photographs (7 color, 55 black and white), one negative and two postcards. Several photographs come from the mid-1930s, but the bulk is from the late 1940s, after Reeves returned from the war, and from the McCullers' stay in Bachivillers, France during the early 1950s. There are also some snapshots from the 1960s. Apart from McCullers herself, the people represented are primarily family members (her mother and sister) and friends, including Mary Mercer, Edwin Peacock, John Zeigler, and the Italian writer Alberto Moravia. The series is arranged in roughly chronological order, accompanied by a partial itemized inventory. </p>
