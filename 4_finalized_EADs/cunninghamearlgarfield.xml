The remainder of the collection is divided into <emph render="bold">Military Awards</emph>, <emph render="bold">Military Records</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> series. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture.</p>
