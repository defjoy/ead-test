         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Great Kanto earthquake struck the Japanese island of Honshu at 11:58 a.m. on September 1, 1923. With a magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale, the earthquake leveled Tokyo and the surrounding areas of Yokohama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizouka. Along with the destruction of buildings and land, the earthquake resulted in widespread fires, as many people had been cooking their lunch around the time that the earthquake struck. A simultaneous typhoon in Northern Japan led to high winds that caused firestorms in cities across the region. </p>
         
         <p>Estimated casualties from the earthquake and the resulting fires range from 100,000 to 150,000 people. About 2 million people were left homeless. Over the next several years, Tokyo was rebuilt with stricter safety standards, and more parks were added to offer open spaces as refuges. In 1960, the Japanese government declared September 1 to be Disaster Prevention Day. </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Materials in this collection include a mixture of formats documenting the aftermath of the Kanto earthquake. A set of 18 postcards, tinted with color in some cases, contain photographs of wrangled railroad systems, destroyed buildings, evacuees, and mass casualties from the earthquake. There is a photo-illustrated pamphlet, which includes black and white images of the devestated areas. Also included is a copy of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">International Graphic Magazine</title>, which includes reporting in Japanese as well as images from the disaster. This magazine appears to be missing its back cover. Two special issues of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Daishinsai Shashin Gaho</title>, from September and October 1923, include photo illustrations of destruction along with early attempts at rescue and recovery. Finally, the collection includes a folded color map of Tokyo and the affected area, and a scrapbook of newsprint and printed images from after the earthquake. The scrapbook has been bound as a folio, and its news articles are also in Japanese.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
