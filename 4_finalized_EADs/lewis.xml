            <p>Professor Lewis threw out many of his papers
			 upon moving from the University of Chicago to Duke
			 University in 1976. He only kept half a file-drawer filled
			 with longer letters. At Duke, without a personal secretary
			 to file for him, he discarded most items as he finished
			 with them. (From notes of Bob Byrd, Director of Special

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of H. Gregg Lewis, an economist and
		  university professor, span the period 1939 to 1990 with the
		  bulk of the collection dating from the early 1980s. The
		  collection is comprised chiefly of research and background
		  materials for his book
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Union Relative Wage Effects: A
		  Survey</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1986), and of
		a collection of various academic articles (mostly working
		papers on various topics in labor economics). Materials
		represented in this particular collection include book
		manuscripts; drafts of papers (including unpublished
		articles); correspondence; lecture notes and syllabi for
		several classes taught at Chicago and for others at Duke;
		referee reports; administrative paperwork associated with
		the University of Chicago; and papers written by other
		economists. The primary subjects covered in this collection
		are: labor economics, trade unions and relative wage
		effects, University of Chicago Department of Economics, and
		Duke University Department of Economics. Important and/or
		substantial correspondence includes those with Gary Becker,
		Walter Oi, Albert Reese, Sherwin Rosen, and Finis
		Welch.</p>
         
         <p>H. Gregg Lewis, one of the founders of modern
		  labor economics, brought an unbiased, empirical approach to
		  a field then dominated by the institutionalist school.
		  According to Sherwin Rosen,</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>Professor Lewis was a pioneer in promoting
			 empirical research with strong microeconomic foundations
			 and in expanding the range of substantive problems that
			 were amenable to economic analysis. This may be his most
			 important legacy to economics. (Rosen, 1994).</p>
         
         </blockquote>
         
         <p>A meticulous researcher, Lewis trained his
		  methodical, detail-oriented eye on topics that included the
		  allocation of time between market and non-market
		  activities, the allocation of labor among alternative uses,
		  and the compensation of labor. It is the topic of the
		  influence of trade unions on wage differentials, however,
		  to which Lewis contributed the bulk of his published work.
		  His first book, titled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Unionism and Relative Wages in
		  the United States: an Empirical Enquiry </title>was
		published in 1963, and his second book,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Union Relative Wage Effects: A
		  Survey </title>was published in 1986.</p>
         
         <p>Lewis was linked to the University of Chicago
		  Department of Economics for over forty years, first as an
		  undergraduate and then as a graduate student, but for most
		  of this time as a faculty member. As such, his career was
		  inextricably linked to the events and personages of
		  Chicago. He studied under Lloyd Mints, Henry Schultz, and
		  Henry Simons and later was a colleague of Paul Douglas, Ted
		  Schultz, Gale Johnson, Albert Reese, Al Harberger, Milton
		  Friedman, Harry Johnson, Robert Fogel, and James Heckman,
		  to name a few of the eminent economists at the University
		  of Chicago during his tenure there.</p>
         
         <p>The papers are organized in series as follows:
		  Research Notes, Drafts and Proofs Series; Articles,
		  Comments and Notes Series; Correspondence Series; Teaching
		  Materials Series; and Colleagues' Articles: Indexed
		  Series.</p>
         
         <p>The Research Notes, Drafts and Proofs Series dates
		  from around the early 1980s and contains all material found
		  in the collection which relate to Professor Lewis' book
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Union Relative Wage Effects: A
		  Survey</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1986). His two
		books are more than just summaries of the existing
		literature; they also involved extensive work of his own.
		For example, he recalculated a substantial amount of the
		data presented in the studies in order to replace or
		correct what he perceived as errors. As such, this series
		contains much more than the expected background notes,
		manuscripts, and proofs. It is comprised of approximately
		300 manila folders, each meticulously grouped together by
		Lewis and sequentially numbered within the groupings. A
		single manila folder might contain an article/study; notes
		on that article (e.g. on data sources and coverage, sample
		restrictions, controls, and definitions of variables);
		correspondence with the authors of the studies asking for
		clarification on statistics, variables, and equations;
		notes showing the numbers which Lewis obtained in reworking
		the authors' calculations; and manuscript drafts of each
		chapter. His 1986 book is essentially a synthesis of a
		number of studies on the relative wage effects of unions,
		and an update of his earlier
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Unionism and Relative Wages in
		  the United States: an Empirical Enquiry</title> (University
		of Chicago Press, 1963). In his second book, Lewis looked
		specifically at different studies written post-1963 that
		analyzed the union versus non-union relative wage
		differential. These studies largely use micro data on
		individual workers for structural modeling. Unlike his 1963
		book, most of the studies analyzed in
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Union Relative Wage
		  Effects</title> are not University of Chicago economics
		theses.</p>
         
         <p>The Articles, Comments, and Notes Series contains
		  articles written by Professor Lewis -- many of which were
		  never published. These include: "How Americans Use their
		  Time" (1975), "Notes on Partial Equilibrium Analysis"
		  (1975), "Notes on Corner Problems in Production and Utility
		  Theory" (no date), "Unionism, Wages and Employment in U.S.
		  Coal Mining, 1945-68" (1971), "Notes on the Shadow Price of
		  Household Time" (no date), "The Impact of Unionism on
		  Relative Wages in the U.S." (1963), "Employer Interests in
		  Employee Hours of Work" (late 1960s), "Notes on the
		  Economics of Hours of Work" (1967), and various article
		  reprints and comments that were published during the
		  1930s-1950s. This series also contains drafts of comments
		  on colleagues' papers that were published. In addition,
		  there are background notes on various topics, e.g. notes on
		  a paper that he and Gary Becker worked on jointly regarding
		  the interaction between the quantity and quality of
		  children. This series also contains a copy of Professor
		  Lewis' Ph.D. thesis, "Studies in the Elasticity of the
		  Demand for Steel" (University of Chicago, March 1947).</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence Series is quite a substantive
		  collection of letters Professor Lewis wrote to fellow
		  economists or received from them over the period 1958 -
		  1986. It also includes a file containing referee reports
		  (mostly done for the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Political
		  Economy</title>). Note that the "University of Chicago"
		file excludes those pieces of correspondence with Albert
		Reese (who served as the Chairman of the Department of
		Economics during the 1960s). Instead, those letters are
		found in the file "Correspondence with Al Reese." The file
		titled "University of Chicago Department of Economics"
		contains correspondence that mostly relates to
		administrative duties that Lewis had as Director of
		Graduate Studies. Note that the "Milton Friedman" file is
		sparse, containing only three letters written between
		Friedman and Lewis. The "AEA Distinguished Fellow, 1981"
		file contains letters of congratulations from friends and
		colleagues upon his receipt of this prestigious award. </p>
         
         <p>The Teaching Materials Series covers the period
		  1967-1986. In chronological order, it contains the lecture
		  notes for classes taught both at the University of Chicago
		  and at Duke. In addition, there are five files (ca. 1979)
		  on University of Chicago dissertations which he supervised
		  even after moving to Duke. In the words of Sherwin Rosen,
		  one of his former students, Professor Lewis wielded his
		  influence largely in the one-on-one teaching he did,
		  serving on the committees of over 90 graduate students at
		  Chicago, and supervising six Ph.D. dissertations at Duke.
		  According to Rosen, his real forte was in this capacity as
		  thesis advisor engaged in... </p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>...one-on-one teaching in his office, discussing
			 thesis problems and progress and training young economists
			 how to do research. He had no peer in those endeavors. He
			 was extraordinarily unselfish and generous to students in
			 giving away his ideas, time, and criticism." (Rosen,
			 1994).</p>
         
         </blockquote>
         
         <p>His teaching efforts in the classroom, moreover,
		  did not go unnoticed; at the University of Chicago he was
		  awarded the Quantrell Prize for excellence in undergraduate
		  teaching, and at Duke he was given the United Methodist's
		  Teacher-Scholar award, both in recognition of his
		  outstanding teaching.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the Colleagues' Articles: Indexed Series
		  contains working papers and any hand-written notes (e.g.
		  Lewis' calculations) on these papers. There are also pieces
		  of correspondence related to the papers interspersed
		  throughout this series.</p>
