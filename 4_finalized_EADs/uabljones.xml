         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Barney Lee Jones was born in Raleigh, NC on June 11, 1920, the only child of Barney Lee Jones and Gladys Estelle Upshur. Orphaned at an early age, he was raised in Norfolk, VA by his aunt, Mary Lee Upshur and her husband Roy Elliott.  He was greatly influenced by his grandmothers: Julia Estelle (Stella) Andrews Upshur, a Norfolk newspaperwoman, urged him to take his studies seriously; Hattie Parker Jones nurtured his faith during his summers on the family farm in North Carolina.</p>
            
            <p>
After graduating from Maury High School in Norfolk in 1938, Barney attended Duke University where he received his BA in 1941. While enrolled at Yale University Divinity School, he served as pastor of the United Methodist Church of Woodbury, CT.  He also met fellow student Marjorie H. Curts, whom he married on June 5, 1944.  Upon completing his Bachelor of Divinity degree, Jones enlisted as a chaplain in the US Navy (1944-1946) and served in the Pacific theater during the last months of World War II.  He returned to the Navy to serve in the Korean War after doing graduate work at Yale (1946-1948) and working as an instructor in the Department of Religion at Duke (1948-1950).</p>
            
            <p>
In 1953, Barney returned to Duke for the rest of his professional career.  He served as Chaplain to the University until 1956 when he moved into the administration and instructional arenas as Assistant Dean of Trinity College and Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion.  He received his PhD from the Divinity School in 1958.  Dr. Jones received the Duke Alumni Association's "Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching Award" for the 1977-1978 academic year.  He retired from Duke University as Professor Emeritus in 1984. He died from cancer on April 12, 2005 at his home in New York.
