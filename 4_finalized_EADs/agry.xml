         <abstract>The Alliance for the Guidance of Rural
            Youth was a vocational guidance service organization originally created under the
            leadership of Orie Latham Hatcher as the Virginia Bureau of Vocations for Women
            (1914-1921), and later known as the Southern Woman's Educational Alliance (1921-1937).
            Disbanded in 1963. The records comprise an extensive set of organizational
            records for Alliance for the Guidance of Rural Youth and its predecessors. Series
            include correspondence, administrative files, project files, conference files, subject
            files, writings and speeches, publications, clippings, press releases, and photographic
            materials, which include prints and nitrate negatives. The records document the
            organization's evolution from its early focus on increasing vocational opportunities for
            educated southern women and rural high school girls to its later activities in providing
            county-wide vocational programming for rural youth. Additional subjects addressed in the
            papers and photographs include economic conditions throughout the South; migration
            patterns from U.S. rural regions to cities; Appalachian culture, including crafts and
            music; community life in the South; and employment for African Americans. The collection
            includes 42 matted platinum prints of rural citizens and scenes in Kentucky taken in the
            1930s by noted photographer Doris Ulmann, and include a portrait of her assistant and
            folklorist, John Jacob Niles.</abstract>

         <p>Although the Alliance for the Guidance of Rural Youth officially came into being in
            1937, its work stretched back to 1914, with the founding of the Virginia Bureau of
            Vocations for Women by Orie Hatcher and several other Richmond women. The roots of this
            first organization can be traced back to Hatcher's work with the Virginia Association of
            Colleges and Schools for Girls. As one of the association's founders in 1906, Hatcher
            was quickly elected to chair several successive committees designed to evaluate
            educational standards in Virginia's women's schools. Several surveys on women's colleges
            done by these committees clearly showed that educational standards in southern women's
            colleges were far below their northern counterparts and in fact did little to prepare
            women for careers other than teaching and homemaking. Hatcher's tenure at Bryn Mawr had
            exposed her to the women's employment bureaus which were emerging in the North. The
            Virginia Bureau of Vocations for Woman was thus created out of Hatcher's desire to
            reform women's education so that it provided a means to meaningful employment.</p>
         
         <p>To meet this mission, the Bureau sought to open up new career paths for women and to
            provide a reliable source of information and sound counseling regarding education and
            occupational training for Virginia women. Because so few schools offered a curriculum
            that would train women directly for a specific occupation, the Virginia Bureau often
            lobbied various institutions to include educational programs that would prepare women
            for work. By working with other women's organizations and by using public opinion, the
            Bureau was an instrumental force in persuading the Medical School of Virginia to admit
            women to its dentistry, pharmacy, and medical programs, and in fact recruited the
            school's first twelve female students. In a similar manner, the Bureau was also able to
            influence the Richmond School of Social Economy to change to the Richmond School of
            Social Work and Public Health and for the Smithdeal Business College in Richmond to
            create a secretarial school which would serve women wanting to receive professional
            clerical training. </p>
         
         <p>By 1920, the Bureau's mission had broadened, and it began to see itself as more of a
            regional group which represented emerging opportunities for southern women. To reflect
            this broader constituency, the Bureau changed its name to the Southern Woman's
            Educational Alliance and acquired new visibility through the addition of prominent
            regional and national figures to its board. By establishing branches in Atlanta,
            Chicago, New York, Washington, and Richmond, the Alliance was able to broaden its base
            of support. The primary functions of the branches were fundraising and promotion.
            Consequently, prominent and wealthy women such as Irene Gibson, her sister Lady Astor,
            and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson were recruited to help organize the branches.</p>
         
         <p>The desire to get vocational information to women at a time when it would be most useful
            to their employment and career development eventually led SWEA to explore the role of
            vocational guidance for high school girls, especially those who would never attend
            college. This aspect of vocational guidance was particularly relevant in the South,
            where rural youth migrated out of their communities to look for work in cities. In
            exploring the vocational needs of rural high school girls, SWEA quickly realized that it
            would not be effective to separate guidance services for boys and girls in rural schools
            and therefore shifted its focus to rural youth in general. Although SWEA did not
            formally change its name until 1937, the organization was working exclusively on rural
            youth guidance by 1930.</p>
         
         <p>Conference activity took on an increasingly important role in fulfilling the
            organization's mission of gathering and disseminating information on various vocational
            topics. From about 1918, the Virginia Bureau co-sponsored conferences with the Virginia
            Association of Colleges and Schools for Girls, National Committee of Bureaus of
            Occupation for Trained Women, and the National Federation of Business and Professional
            Women's Clubs. During the 1920s SWEA sponsored several conferences on occupational
            trends for women, developing guidance programs for women's colleges and schools, and
            effective guidance aids f or rural girls.</p>
         
         <p>During the 1930s and 1940s, SWEA and AGRY s conference activity increased significantly.
            Alliance members participated in conferences sponsored by NVGA, CGPA, NOC, and NEA by
            chairing sessions and presenting papers on rural youth guidance. In addition, the
            Alliance sponsored several series of guidance conferences and forums on its own. Notable
            among these are the Pine Mountain Guidance Institutes, 1937-1942; Rural-Urban Institutes
            on Youth Migration, 1938-1939; luncheon forums for Washington (D.C.) youth-serving
            agencies, 1942-1947; and the Rural Guidance Institute held in conjunction with the
            group's annual board meetings.</p>
         
         <p>With the success of Orie Hatcher's <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Occupations for Women</title>
            (1927), the Alliance began to publish book-length research reports. <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Rural Girls in the City for Work</title> (1930) and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Handicaps of Elementary School Girls</title> (1931) resulted from
            Rural Guidance Project research done in North Carolina. <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Guidance
               Work in the Schools of Craven Co., North Carolina</title> (1930), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Guiding Rural Boys and Girls</title> (1930), <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A
               Mountain School</title> (1930) and others were the product of the Alliance's work in
            North Carolina and Virginia with experimental county-wide guidance programs. These
            longer publications were instrumental 1n promoting the efforts of the Alliance. </p>
         
         <p>The Alliance's far-reaching work in the field of rural youth guidance served to
            establish the organization as a national authority. After Hatcher's death in 1946, the
            group continued its research projects, publications, and conference activities under the
            direction of Amber Arthun Warburton who became the organization's executive secretary.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The records of the Alliance for Guidance of Rural Youth (AGRY) span the years 1887 to
            1963, although the bulk of the collection begins in 1914 with the creation of the
            organization and ends in 1946 with the death of founder and president, Orie Latham
            Hatcher. Additional records for the Alliance from 1947 to 1963 can be found in the Amber
            Arthun Warburton papers, also located in the Rubenstein Library.</p>
         
         <p>The records comprise an extensive set of organizational records for AGRY and its
            predecessors, the Virginia Bureau of Vocations for Women (VBVW) and the Southern Woman's
            Educational Alliance (SWEA), and document the organization's evolution from its early
            focus on increasing vocational opportunities for educated southern women and rural high
            school girls to its later activities in providing county-wide vocational programming for
            rural youth. Series include correspondence, administrative files, project files,
            conference files, subject files, writings and speeches, publications, clippings, press
            releases, and photographic materials, which include prints and nitrate negatives.</p>
         
         <p>Early materials in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Administrative Files</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Clippings and Press
               Releases</emph> series document the Bureau's projects, such as the speaker's bureau
            and the scholarship program, as well as the Bureau's relationship with other women's
            organizations such as the Virginia Association of Colleges and Schools for Girls,
            Southern Collegiate Women (later the American Association of University Women), the
            National Federation of Business and Professional Women Clubs (BPW), and the National
            Council of Women.</p>
         
         <p>Strong ties were developed between the Bureau and these organizations during its
            formative years: Hatcher chaired national and local committees in most of these
            organizations, and early correspondence and administrative files center on her work with
            these organizations particularly concerning educational standards and vocational
            training in women's colleges. In these early records it is often unclear which of these
            activities were officially adopted by the Bureau or if they were solely Hatcher's
            activities.</p>
         
         <p>The AGRY's activities documented in the <emph render="bold">Branch Files Series</emph>
            include benefits, forums, exhibits, and festivals. The New York Branch sponsored several
            opera benefits to help raise funds during the 1920s. The Rural Mountain Festival,
            sponsored by the Richmond Branch, was held in 1938. In 1932, the Alliance commissioned
            noted New York portrait photographer, Doris Ulmann, to photograph rural youth and other
            individuals in Kentucky. The photographs were subsequently exhibited by several of the
            branches and were used to promote discussion of vocational issues and the work of the
            Alliance. Forty-two of these original platinum prints are located in the <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>Organizational changes reflected modifications in the organization's goals. Although
            SWEA continued many of the projects started by the Virginia Bureau, emphasis shifted
            away from lobbying efforts aimed to open new careers for women and more towards research
            on women's occupational trends and model guidance counseling programs based on that
            research. <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> during the early 1920s contains
            letters from faculty and administrators from women's colleges throughout the Northeast
            and South which describe various approaches (or lack thereof) to providing vocational
            guidance to students. Administrative files contain information on surveys and on a
            vocational guidance course for college women which was developed at Goucher College
            under the auspices of SWEA and tested at Duke University (then Trinity College) and the
            College of William and Mary. The <emph render="bold">Publications</emph> and <emph render="bold">Clippings and Press Releases</emph> series also contain considerable
            information regarding Alliance research and activities during this time.</p>
         
         <p>During the mid to late 1920s, SWEA sponsored several research projects through its Rural
            Guidance Project which examined vocational trends of rural girls in North Carolina and
            Virginia. While the <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> and <emph render="bold">Administrative Files</emph> series document how the projects were organized, the
            comprehensive data collected during these projects is extant only in resulting SWEA
            publications such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Rural Girls in the City for Work</title> and
            the unpublished manuscript "Fifty Rural High School Girls."</p>
         
         <p>Alliance projects in the late 1920s and 1930s consisted of experimental and
            demonstration guidance programs in rural schools. These projects were located at the
            Konnarock Training School (Va.), elementary schools in Albemarle Co., Va., Farm Life
            School (Craven Co., N.C.), and elementary and secondary schools in Breathitt Co., Ky,
            among others. Each of these demonstration projects also resulted in substantial Alliance
            publications which in most cases represent the bulk of extant documentation of each
            project. The <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials</emph> series contains many
            snapshots taken in these various communities, although most are of poor quality and
            unidentified. Additional information may also appear scattered throughout <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Clippings, and Administrative Files</emph> series.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Breathitt County Project Files Series</emph>, provides the most
            comprehensive documentation of the demonstration project which grew to become the
            Alliance's main research activity from about 1934 to 1942. The project encompassed a
            wide range of activities including data collection on students' home life, teacher
            training workshops, vocational guidance programming through the county's Planning
            Council, and a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1938. Particularly noteworthy in these
            materials are the extensive raw data files consisting of approximately 2500
            autobiographical surveys of students. Additional files contain charts of data
            compilations and teacher reports which identify trends in students' educational
            behavior. Photographs of Breathitt County schools, students, and home life, chiefly
            taken by noted photographer Doris Ullman, are contained in the <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>SWEA and AGRY's emphasis on research and dissemination of information was reflected in
            the increase of published materials produced by the organization. Much of this material
            is contained in the <emph render="bold">Publications Series</emph>. Clippings of book
            reviews document the wide-spread acceptance of these publications in a newly emerging
            field. Several unpublished manuscripts resulting from Alliance research projects are
            extant in the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</emph> and include
            "Occupations for Educated Women in Durham, Raleigh, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina"
            (1926), a bound copy of "Fifty Rural High School Girls'' (1930), and final drafts of
            "When Our Young Folks Come Home to the Smaller Communities" (1945).</p>
         
         <p>Another strategy for publicizing the work of the Alliance was through local and national
            radio broadcasts. Shows were broadcast from Richmond, New York, and Washington, D.C.,
            and gave information on specific occupations and discussed vocational guidance issues.
            Broadcast scripts contained in the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches
               Series</emph> feature youths interviewing each other and Orie Hatcher about career
            goals, a dialogue between Eleanor Roosevelt and Hatcher on the future of rural youth
            (1938), and a presentation by Amelia Earhart on women in aviation (1931).</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Clippings and Press Releases</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series demonstrate the Alliance's shift away from
            relationships with women's organizations in the late 1920s and towards guidance and
            educational organizations such as the American Council for Guidance and Personnel
            Associations (CGPA), National Vocational Guidance Association (NVGA), National
            Occupational Conference (NOC), National Education Association (NEA), and the U.S.
            Department of Education in the 1930s. In many of these organizations, Hatcher chaired
            committees on rural youth, and representatives from these groups served on AGRY's Board
            of Trustees.</p>
         
         <p>Numerous regional and national conference activities are reflected in the <emph render="bold">Conference Files Series</emph>, with a complete set of conference
            proceedings and findings contained in the <emph render="bold">Publications
            Series</emph>. Information on pre-1930s conferences is slim, but additional information
            on all conferences can be gleaned from the <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> and
               <emph render="bold">Clippings and Press Releases</emph> series. Copies of papers
            delivered by Alliance members and others are located in the <emph render="bold">Writings
               and Speeches Series</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>Materials dating past Hatcher's tenure in the Alliance consist mainly of routine
            administrative correspondence. A more complete set of AGRY organizational records dating
            from 1947-1963 is located in the papers of Amber Arthun Warburton, her successor. These
            records continue several series started in the AGRY records such as executive board
            minutes, publications, project files, and correspondence.</p>

         <head>Processing Note</head>
         
         <p>The Alliance for the Guidance of Rural Youth was created by Hatcher who dominated its
            administration until her death. The Alliance was her organization and her life as well.
            This relationship is evident throughout the records, particularly in the earlier records
            when it is often difficult to discern the difference between Alliance records and
            Hatcher's personal papers. Because these distinctions are ambiguous and often
            contradictory, no attempt has been made to provide a separate category of personal
            papers. The Virginia DeMott Cox papers held in the Rubenstein Library contain several
            oral history tapes which reveal a more personal side of Hatcher and her work with the
            Alliance.</p>
         
         <p>During the processing of this collection, duplicate items were discarded and some
            reference materials were transferred to the Duke Libraries general collections. These
            materials included a large quantity of printed materials on citizenship, eugenics,
            veterans' education, juvenile delinquency in Great Britain, population trends, etc. and

         <p>The collection also contained a considerable quantity of clippings from newspapers and
            periodicals. Clippings relating directly to the Alliance's activities were retained.
            These clippings were originally pasted in several scrapbooks which were showing signs of
            rapid deterioration. These scrapbooks were dismantled, copied onto acid-free paper, and
            filed in the appropriate series. Other general news clippings from mainstream newspapers
            which can be found online such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Washington Post, The New
               York Times</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Richmond Times Dispatch</title>
            were discarded. Large quantities of newsclippings from the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Jackson Times</title> (Breathitt Co., Ky.) and the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Harlan
               Daily News</title> (Harlan Co., Ky.) concerning social life in both counties were
            also discarded.</p>

               <p>Materials published and distributed by the Alliance are divided into two groups.
                  Smaller publications such as brochures, newsletters and conference proceedings are
                  arranged alphabetically by type. Books and longer research reports are arranged
                  chronologically by date of publication. <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Twenty-five Years
                     of Work</title> (1939) provides an extensive history of the organization.

               <p>Black-and-white snapshots, negatives, and platinum prints depicting individuals
                  living in rural areas of Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Most
                  of the photographs and corresponding negatives were taken by Alliance staff in
                  locations where vocational workshops or research projects were conducted:
                  Breathitt County, Kentucky; Pine Mountain, Kentucky; Craven County, North
                  Carolina; Ocracoke, North Carolina; Konnarock Training School, Virginia; Pleasant
                  Hill Academy, Tennessee, and other mountain or rural mission schools. Included are
                  two pictures of Rural Alliance leader Orie Hatcher and friends taken in 1887 and
                  1901.</p>
               
               <p>Also contains 41 original matted and signed 6x8 inch platinum prints, negatives,
                  and other prints by photographer Doris Ulmann, taken in Kingdom Come and Hindman,
                  Kentucky, consisting of carefully composed portraits of rural residents,
                  commissioned by the Southern Women's Educational Alliance of Richmond. Subjects
                  consist of family groups and individuals, chiefly children, youth, and women, but
                  including some men; many individuals are identified by name in the Ulmann's notes,
                  along with comments on their lives and personalities. One image taken by Ulmann in
                  her studio features her assistant and Appalachian folklorist and musician John
                  Jacob Niles. Includes a typed list of titles and notes for each print, identifying
                  most individuals, and copies of photographs intended for publication, according to
                  original folder titles. </p>
               
               <p>Series is arranged in two groupings: Alliance materials, and Doris Ulmann
                  materials.</p>

                     <p>Nitrate film negatives from snapshots taken by Women's Education Alliance
                        staff, circa 1930s. The single negatives typically measure 2x2 or 2x3
                        inches. Images were taken chiefly in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia.
                        Place names that have been identified are Breathitt (Ky.); Crozet (Va.?);
                        Red Hill; Konnarock Training School (KTS) and KHS, possibly Konnarock High
                        School, Whitetop (Va.); and Midway (Va.?). Subjects are chiefly white girls
                        and women, in groups or single portraits. Hand-written notes that were
                        photocopied from the wrappers that accompanied the negatives usually include
                        first names and initials of last names, and some details about family
                        members present. A few of the nitrate negatives are deteriorated but most
                        are in good condition.</p>

                  <p>Contains a total of 42 signed, matted platinum prints by noted photographer
                     Doris Ulmann that were commissioned by the Richmond branch of the Southern
                     Woman's Educational Alliance and which were found among its archives. Titles
                     and captions are taken directly from the inventory for 95 prints (represented
                     by 92 entries); original spellings and colloquialisms have been retained.
                     Although Ullman most likely authored the titles and captions, this has not been
                     verified.</p>
                  
                  <p>The matted platinum prints are arranged in legacy identification number order
                     (marked on backs), a system probably deriving from Rural Alliance staff who
                     obtained the prints from Ullman for exhibition and publicity. They measure 6x8
                     inches, the size of the glass plate negatives used by Ullman, and are glued to
                     original 11x14 inch cream-colored window mats with paper hinges, a few of which
                     are detached. Most are signed by Ulmann in pencil on the mount, on the right
                     side just below the print. The mats are fragile; please handle with care. The
                     glass plates are not included in the collection; they may still exist within
                     the New York Historical Society's large collection of Ullman photographs and
                     negatives.</p>

                        has not been positively identified as Fred Stampler. There was a large
                        family of musicians in Hindman by the name of Stamper (Hiram). The fiddler
                        is unidentified in this image, but a solo portrait of the same individual
                        shows up in other Ulmann collections as "Mr. Storr". </p>
