         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Sigma Delta Chapter of Kappa Delta was charted at Duke University in 1912.  Its charter members included Mary Gorham, Lucille Gorham, Katie Lee McKinnon, Estelle Flowers, and Catherine Thomas.</p>
         
         <p>
During 1915, meetings were held in the home of Mary White Cranford. The women wanted a chapter house on campus, but President Few opposed the idea.  Sigma Delta continued to have monthly meetings off campus until 1916, when they were granted meeting space in the Woman's Building.  In fall 1918, the women moved into a suite in Alspaugh Hall.</p>
         
         <p>
During the first year of their Kappa Delta affiliation, the Sigma Delta chapter attended a Halloween party, gave two rushing parties, and attended garden parties. Some other activities enjoyed by the Sigma Delta chapter were: a "Dream Ship Cruise" themed ball with fellow fraternity men, War Chest and YMCA philanthropy, slumber parties, and supporting Hungarian exchange students at Duke. Kappa Delta also participated in Greek Night and created a float for Joe College Weekend.</p>
         
         <p>
The Sigma Delta chapter lost its charter in 1967 but was re-chartered in 1976.  From 1976 to 1981, the chapter was active on campus, but again lost its charter in 1990. The sorority was formerly governed by the Panhellenic Association at Duke University.
