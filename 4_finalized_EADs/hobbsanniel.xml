         <abstract>Annie L. Hobbs of Laconia, N.H. was an instructor at the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College (Methodist) in Tilton, N.H. and at the Troy Conference Academy in Poultney, Vt. during the 1850s and 1860s. Collection contains two manuscript pocket diaries, dated 1867 and 1869, and two pocket memoranda books, dated 1854-1855, 1859, and 1863-1865, kept by Annie L. Hobbs, an instructor at the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College (Methodist) in Tilton, Belknap County, New Hampshire and at the Troy Conference Academy in Poultney, Rutland County, Vermont. In the diaries, Hobbs records her travels to and from her schools, evening readings, croquet games, naps, teas, Saturday excursions, her sewing work, occasional written work, receipt of letters and newspapers, Methodist festivals and Sabbath observances, and fluctuations in her health. Hobbs also regularly records her moods and her uncertainty about whether or not to go back for another term. Generally, the diaries document the life of a young female teacher living away from home, her daily routine, social contacts, and her intellectual pursuits. In the two memoranda books, Hobbs records student names and recitation periods, Lyceum lectures she attended, mathematical equations, and her expenses for 1863 to 1865.</abstract>
