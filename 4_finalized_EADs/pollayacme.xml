         <abstract>The Acme Advertising Collection is one of the collections created by Professor Richard Pollay in the History of Advertising Archives (Faculty of Commerce, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia). The collection was motivated by the observation that Acme named enterprises are characteristically small ventures that represent the grass roots of local and regional economies.  At the same time, the ubiquity of the Acme brand name has made its way into popular culture, where it has become an icon for independent business in general, featured in print cartoons from artists such as Gary Larson (The Far Side) and G.B. Trudeau (Doonesbury), and in the Warner Bros. animated Road Runner features.  Items in the Acme Collection come from a variety of sources. Many items were donated to Dr. Pollay, but the majority were acquired by Dr. Pollay himself over several decades. In earlier years items were found in shops, flea markets, and antique stores across North America. However, in recent years most items were acquired through the internet auction site, eBay (www.eBay.com). The Acme Advertising Collection dates from the 1850s through 2006 and consists of approximately 3000 items from over 900 distinct companies and producers, primarily of U.S. or Canadian origin, all bearing the brand name Acme.  The collection contains a diverse array of items, both three-dimensional and printed materials, including: promotional items and memorabilia; trade cards; business cards; magazine tear sheets; catalogs; newspaper clippings; signs; displays; writing instruments; rulers; clothing; toys and games; school and office stationery supplies; photographs and slides.  A number of corporations are represented in the collection, including: Acme Bail Bonds; Acme Boots; Acme Brick Company; Acme Harvester; Acme Markets; Acme Motor Truck Company; Acme White Lead and Color Works; Duane H. Nash, Inc.; Lautz Bros. and Company; and Warner Bros.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Acme Advertising Collection dates from the 1850s through 2006 and consists of approximately 3000 items from over 900 distinct companies and producers, primarily of U.S. or Canadian origin, all bearing the brand name Acme.  The collection contains a diverse array of items, both three-dimensional and printed materials, including: promotional items and memorabilia; trade cards; business cards; magazine tear sheets; catalogs; newspaper clippings; signs; displays; writing instruments; rulers; clothing; toys and games; school and office stationery supplies; photographs and slides.  A number of corporations are represented in the collection, including: Acme Bail Bonds; Acme Boots; Acme Brick Company; Acme Harvester; Acme Markets; Acme Motor Truck Company; Acme White Lead and Color Works; Duane H. Nash, Inc.; Lautz Bros. and Company; and Warner Brothers.</p>
         
         <p>A significant part of the collection is organized and grouped to represent rooms in a house. For example, kitchen items have been collected together. Office, wardrobe, and bathroom items are similarly gathered.  Most items are represented in the Detailed Description by thumbnail images. In all, the collection consists of 28 Series: <emph render="bold">Kitchen Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Wardrobe and Bedroom Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Toys, Games, Sports and Recreation</emph>; <emph render="bold">Office and School Supplies</emph>; <emph render="bold">Domestic Hardware</emph>; <emph render="bold">Grocery and Store Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">ACME Beer</emph>; <emph render="bold">Warner Brothers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Clothing Collectibles</emph>; <emph render="bold">Industrial Hardware</emph>; <emph render="bold">Bottles and Jars</emph>; <emph render="bold">Catalogs</emph>; <emph render="bold">Stationery and Certificates</emph>; <emph render="bold">Books and Monographs</emph>; <emph render="bold">Specialty Advertisements</emph>; <emph render="bold">Posters, Magazine, and Newspaper Advertisements</emph>; <emph render="bold">Sales Oddities</emph>; <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>; <emph render="bold">eBay Files</emph>; <emph render="bold">Acme Bail Bonds; Acme Truck</emph>; <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph>; <emph render="bold">Match Covers</emph>; <emph render="bold">Telephone Directories</emph>; <emph render="bold">Business Cards</emph>; <emph render="bold">Trade Cards</emph>; <emph render="bold">Slides</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Items</emph>. </p>
         
         <p>The collection arrived already organized into 28 series. Every item had been assigned an <emph render="doublequote">accession number,</emph> a unique 8-digit identifier, in the format <emph render="doublequote">100-xx-xxx</emph>: the middle digits refer to the Series number, and the last three digits represent a running accession sequence within the Series.  Items have been arranged by Series and numerically therein; however, there are a few exceptions where items have been transferred to another series after having been previously assigned an accession number. The collection also arrived with a descriptive database that was created and maintained by Professor Pollay's staff. The item descriptions in this finding aid represent a distillation of that database into a form more consistent with EAD-compliant finding aids. The collection has been minimally processed, with the original order maintained as much as possible. In addition, some items have been deaccessioned or retained by the donor, and only a digital image of the item exists in the collection. Those have been noted in the inventory.</p>
