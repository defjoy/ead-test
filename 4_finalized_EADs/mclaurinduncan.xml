         <abstract>Duncan McLaurin was a farmer, teacher, lawyer, and state legislator of Richmond County, North Carolina. Correspondence, bills, receipts, legal and other papers, and printed matter (1822-1872), of McLaurin and members of his family.  McLaurin's papers (mainly 1822-1850) relate to economic conditions in  North Carolina, South Carolina, and the U.S. in general; the development of infrastructure and education in North and South Carolina; the Civil War; politics in North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia; and national politics, including presidential elections from 1832 to 1848.  Civil War topics include camp life, economic conditions, food supplies, the hope for foreign intervention, morale, conscription and desertion, the blockade of Southern ports, the battles of Murfreesboro (Tennessee), Jackson (Mississippi), Port Royal Harbor (South Carolina), Hanover Court House (Virginia), and the siege of Vicksburg (Mississippi).  A large amount of correspondence from relatives in Mississippi (circa 1830-1867) concerns frontier conditions, slavery, politics, agricultural and labor problems, sectionalism and nationalism in Mississippi, Reconstruction conditions, and family affairs. There are many references to slavery, particularly in Mississippi: the sale of slaves, runaway slaves, a lynching of an African American in 1839, the fear of slave insurrections in 1856 and 1860; and the abolition movement. Includes an atlas with a list of slaves circa 1864 written on the flyleaf.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>The McLaurin collection centers around Duncan McLaurin (1787-1872), a teacher, lawyer, state legislator, and farmer of Richmond County, North Carolina.  Much of the correspondence involves his only brother. John McLaurin (d. 1864), and eight sisters: Mary (d. 1869), Effy (d. 1861), Polly (d. l860s), Barbara McKenzie (d. l855), Elizabeth (d. 1860), Jeanny McCall, Sarah Douglas (d. 1860s), and Isabel Patterson (d. 1860s), and their children.</p>
         
         <p>During the 1820s Duncan McLaurin was engaged in a law practice in his home county, and by 1831 was a member of the state legislature.  In 1834 he accepted a teaching position at an academy in Bennettsville, S.C.  He remained here until 1837, when the failing health of his father forced him to return home and resume his law practice.  The next year he was back in the legislature, and during 1841-1842 he was postmaster at Laurel Hill.  By 1853, however, he was in his sixties, and was looking far an assistant to manage his affairs.  He never married, but lived with a succession of nieces and nephews.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
