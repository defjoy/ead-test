         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>These silk screen posters were created in 1970-71 by a group of women art
students at the Rhode Island School of Design. The group was not organized
around a particular political philosophy, but some of the women were students who transferred from liberal arts colleges and had been influenced by the student movement, Students for a Democratic Society, and the women's liberation movement. The oppostion to the war, an emphasis on women working together and love of making art transformed the dorm room into a small production studio.</p>
         
         <p>The design of the posters were influenced by a number of sources.  An interest in Native American culture (Moon of the Grass Arising), popular music (Fresh Wind Against the Empire), Cuban Revolutionary art, art history (the Etruscan women) and the Paris '68 student posters all are reflected in the posters.
</p>
         
         <p>Along with Nancy Cheser, the other participants included: Judith Rothchild, Jamie Horwitz, Mary Patten, Marcia Ancier, and Ellen Tranes.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
