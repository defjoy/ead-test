         <abstract>Founded in 1864, the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) is one of the largest and oldest enduring advertising agencies in the United States.  John F. Dignam was a commercial artist and an executive with JWT during a 26-year career, in which he held positions of Vice President and Senior Art Director.  The John F. Dignam Papers cover the years 1958-2003, with the bulk of materials dating from the 1960s to 1987, roughly the period during which Dignam served as Art Director with the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) advertising agency.  The collection primarily consists of advertising proofs and commercial artwork created for clients of JWT and other firms, including the Victor A. Bennett Company, along with some of Dignam's freelance work.  The collection also includes a few reports, television commercial scripts and other writings, along with some videocassettes of television commercials.  Companies represented in the collection include the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, British Aerospace, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), Ford Motor Company, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Harveys of Bristol, Jantzen, Pan AMerican World Airways, Inc., the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Standard Brands, and the United States Aircraft Insurance Group (USAIG).</abstract>

I thought it would be nice to see an ad showing the fall scenery, but the cars were being photographed at the same time, so I got our studio in Detroit to make me a piece of art showing fall colors. Also, the Aerodynamics: The Final Touch campaign with Jackie Stewart was also done with artwork. You can't tell the photography from the artwork!</emph>

We bought film and borrowed Ford cars from dealers, got people or family members to pose with them. We presented the photos and hoped to sell the idea. Copy writer Warren Weith and I were sent to Riverside, California to make an ad with the winner. It rained so hard, and we couldn't stay over, so I went out in the rain and shot every car, as they were stopped because of the rain. I shot every one, so when we went back to New York, we found which car had won approval. I had a photo of the car (in the rain), and we put together an ad that eventually ran.</emph>]</p>

                     <p>[<emph render="italic">Dignam remarks: I did a campaign for Goodyear hoses, featuring the Queen Mary, John Deere, and a power project in Texas.  There were 3-color dealer support ads, as well as a poster for belts and hoses.  Posters done by other companies usually featured sexy girls as a way to attract attention; I thought a little girl and a dog would work just as well, and it did!  For the campaign for Omnifilm, the company wanted a sports tie-in, so i worked something up with a photographer, Chuck Lamonica. For a football scene, we rented a sky background; for tennis, we rented a picture of a crowd; and for baseball, we just made a background with a green fence.  For Goodyear Aerospace, the company wanted a simple and direct campaign.  So this campaign, I made a profile of a face and head, because all of the ideas that came out of Goodyear Aerospace were of the mind! But for many years their ideas were all secrets, as they marketed only to the U.S. goverment.</emph>

                        <emph render="italic">My compositions: I drew or painted them on matte board. After Goodyear bought an idea, I sent the designs out to good artists to refine. Clients asked why I didn't do finishes! Before I came on board, the older campaigns were all on the comic side, with art provided by Disney artists. I thought they should be more classy.</emph>]</p>

                     <p>[<emph render="italic">Dignam remarks: Freelance work. While I was working at JWT sometime in the early 1980s, one of my studios, Agency Art, asked me to lunch with Richard (Dick) McGreal. Dick was a Vice President at USAIG. I was told Dick's Art Director had died and they wondered if I could help him. I was working 25 hours a day and weekends on Ford, so I couldn't help him. At the time, I had a Cessna 152, and that's why Agency Art thought that we had things to talk about. Dick and I talked, and I finally agreed to help him until he got a new Art Director. This relationship lasted about 30 years. During that time, I designed their stationery, letterheads, all ads, and posters. I got Ken Taylor of Detroit--he paints cars for GMC, Ford, etc. ads. He's the best airbrush artist I ever saw or worked with! I did all the Aviation News and newsletters every month, also the Notes and Newsnotes. Also all brochures of posters that hang in the offices of USAIG at 1 Seaport Plaza in New York City. I got and went on all photo shoots, and at times I designed all their posters. I also did some artwork for the National Business Aircraft Association (NBAA), the Helicopter Association/International (HAI), and NATA Safety. These folders contain some roughs by me, as well as some color proofing by Ken and Susan Barret of Tucson, Arizona, and by Dr. Mike Alper of Massachusetts. This type of proofing is no longer done this way. I also did a large poster for USAIG's 75th anniversary, along with a brochure that explains all the art in the poster.</emph>]</p>

Heublein &amp; Bros. in Hartford, Connecticut.  The campaign sought to show how good wine was made. I didn't know much about wines, and thought it would make an interesting story and visuals. I was able to get Mitchell Hooks to do the artwork.  Included is an original piece of art by Hooks, and a few page and spread ads.</emph>]</p>

I went to England, France and Portugal to shoot the photos to be used in Pan Am folders and posters, brochures, ads, etc. I took a very good photographer, Bert Glinn, who shot for Life magazine, and we got a lot of good photos in England. Bert's wife is a native of Broadway, and her parents took care of the royal sheep farm, so we had great shots of the countryside, and also in London. In France we photographed 4-star restaurants as well as some exciting scenery. We also went to Portugal where we got more good shots.</emph>]</p>
