         <abstract>Head of a Durham, N.C. advertising firm and
        lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during WWII. Collection contains materials related to Stauber's service in
        the U.S. Navy during World War II. Some of the material contains notes and scripts of
        announcements and news reports made by Stauber on a radio show onboard the USS Biloxi. These
        radio broadcasts are dated January-April and document, among other things, the US invasion
        of Iwo Jima and contain marks of official censorship. A large part of the collection
        consists of correspondence, primarily from Stauber to his mother (1942-1945). Also included
        are photographs of USS Biloxi reunions (1974-1980), one of which was located in Durham,
        North Carolina.</abstract>

         <p>William (Bill) Erwin Stauber ran an advertising agency in Durham, N.C.
        and was a Durham County Commissioner in the 1970s. Stauber graduated from the
          University of North Carolina in 1940 and became a production manager
        for WPTF Radio in Raleigh, N.C. Stauber enlisted
        in the U.S. Navy in 1942 and was a deck officer on the light cruiser
        USS Biloxi in a year and half tour in the Pacific. In 1945, the commanding officer of the
        Biloxi arranged for Stauber to make a daily 3:45 radio broadcast for the ship, giving the
        crew news from the communications office.</p>
