         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Humanities Council of Duke University was
		  originally constituted in 1961. Its function was to give
		  attention to various matters affecting the Humanities
		  departments as a whole, including the advancement of
		  research, interdepartmental and inter-institution programs
		  of lectures, exhibits, seminars, and the support for
		  various humanistic activities. The committee was appointed
		  by the President of the University and consisted of seven
		  faculty members representing the departments of English,
		  Religion, History, Romance Languages, Music, Art, and
		  Philosophy. The first Chair of this committee was Arlin
		  Turner, Professor of English. </p>

      <scopecontent>
         
         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         
         <p>The collection consists of records relating to
		  planning, resource allocation, curriculum, and state of the
		  humanities at the University as dealt with by the
		  Committee. Correspondence, memoranda, reports (typed and
		  annotated), minutes, clipping, charts, projections, and
		  printed programs comprise the bulk of this collection.
		  There exist some materials that are not created out of the
		  general functioning of the committee. These materials,
		  while not being direct results of committee work, help to
		  better understand the functioning and role of the Committee
		  in the life of the University. These materials are mainly
		  dedications programs and leaflets, reports, booklets, and
		  reports from outside bodies, such as the American
		  Comparative Literature Association. </p>
