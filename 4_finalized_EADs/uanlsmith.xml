         <bioghist>
            
            <p>Nancy Lee Smith graduated in 1950 from Washington High School, located in her hometown of Washington, N.C.  She entered the Woman's College at Duke University as a freshman that fall and lived in Brown House.  Smith received full tuition scholarships and earned a place on the Dean's List each year.</p>
            
            <p>
In the Methodist Student Fellowship, she served as community chairman from 1950-1951 and as vice president in 1952.  In 1953, she was elected President of the North Carolina Conference Methodist Youth Fellowship. She attended the United Nations-Washington Seminar as a delegate of the Youth Fellowship in 1953. </p>
            
            <p>
Smith was active in student government and was elected to serve as vice president of the Duke University Women's Student Government Association and was also tapped by Phi Kappa Delta, an honorary leadership society. As an exemplary representative of Duke students, she was selected to serve as a Commencement marshal for the spring 1953 ceremonies.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <scopecontent>
            
            <p>Contains photographs, correspondence, report cards, postcards, playbooks, programs, invitations, telegrams, and clippings. These items were originally included in a scrapbook created by Nancy Lee Smith. The scrapbook was about 100 pages long and contained general items which reflected Smith's religious, social, and academic life at Duke University from 1950 to 1954, and one letter from 1956.  Because the original scrapbook was in poor condition, items were removed and placed in archival folders for preservation.
