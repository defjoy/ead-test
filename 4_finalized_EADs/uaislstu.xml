         <abstract>The program was established in 1977 with funding from the Greater Charlotte Foundation. The program became fully operational in the 1978-1979 academic year under the directorship of Ralph Braibanti.  Studies focused primarily on the Arabian Peninsula and its social, economic, and political developments, and on the resurgence of Islam, with some attention also paid to Arabic archaeology, art, language, law and literature.  Collection contains primarily reports and other printed materials, along with conference programs, and a small amount of the Director's correspondence. Materials range in date from 1976-2000.</abstract>

            <p>The program was established in 1977 with funding from the Greater Charlotte Foundation.  Later on, support was obtained from the government of Saudi Arabia, the Exxon Corporation, and other private and public bodies.  The program became fully operational in the 1978-1979 academic year under the directorship of Ralph Braibanti.  Studies focused primarily on the Arabian Peninsula and its social, economic, and political developments, and on the resurgence of Islam, with some attention also paid to Arabic archaeology, art, language, law and literature.  Several conferences and trips were sponsored, and the program played a role in the visit of Queen Noor of Jordan to Duke in 1985. Funding for the program expired in August 1989, which was also the date of Dr. Braibanti's retirement from active teaching. </p>
