         <abstract>Hertha Sponer, 1895-1968, was a German physicist who immigrated to the United States and came to Duke University in 1936, where she became the first woman on its Physics Department faculty. She conducted research and taught at Duke until 1965, supervising thirty-five masters and doctoral degree graduates. The Hertha Sponer Papers span the years 1917-1967 and  comprise the correspondence, research, speeches, writings, and teaching materials of German physicist Hertha Sponer, who in 1936 became the first woman appointed to the faculty of the Duke University Department of Physics. The collection primarily documents her American career, especially her work in the areas of chemical physics, spectrum analysis, and molecular spectroscopy. Arranged in five series: Correspondence, Printed Materials, Professional Files, Research Files, and Writings and Speeches. The Correspondence Series covers the final two decades of her career, from the late 1940s to 1967, and primarily consists of letters about research with her numerous collaborators and co-authors. Some of her final letters discuss  death of her husband, physicist James Franck, in 1964, and also allude to the death that same year of her Duke Physics Department associate and fellow German refugee, Hedwig Kohn. The Printed Materials Series holds  offprints and reprints of Sponer's articles from the 1930s-1960s, plus a few articles by Franck. Sponer's teaching and administrative files, including correspondence with graduate students, appear in the Professional Files. The Research Files make up the largest series in the collection; these files document her research on many topics and articles and also contain much of the collection's correspondence. The Writings and Speeches Series gathers several papers and talks from the last half-dozen years of Sponer's professional career.</abstract>

         <p>Hertha Sponer, 1895-1968, was a German physicist who became, in 1926, only the second woman awarded the <emph render="italic">Habilitation</emph> in her field--qualification to teach physics at the university level in Germany. She left Germany in 1934, taught two years in Norway and Spain, and arrived at Duke University in 1936, where she became the first woman appointed to its Physics Department faculty. She conducted research and taught at Duke until 1965, supervising thirty-five masters and doctoral degree graduates.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

            </ref> covers the final two decades of Sponer's career, from the late 1940s to 1967. Her primary correspondents were various collaborators and co-authors, with whom she generally discussed research and professional concerns rather than personal matters. Several late letters, though, discuss the 1964 death of her husband, physicist James Franck, and briefly allude to the death that same year of her Duke Physics Department associate and fellow German refugee, Hedwig Kohn. The small <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> is composed of offprints and reprints of Sponer's articles, spanning her entire professional career in America, but also contains a few 1960s articles by Franck. Sponer's teaching and administrative files, including correspondence with Duke graduate students about their theses, are arranged in the <emph render="bold">Professional Files</emph>; this series also includes information about research grants, conferences, and other professional activities. The <emph render="bold">Research Files</emph> make up the largest series in the collection. These files  document Sponer's research on many  topics and articles and also contain much of the collection's correspondence. The Research Files also document the only paper she co-wrote with Hedwig Kohn. The collection concludes with a small <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches</emph> series, which gathers several papers and talks from the last half-dozen years of Sponer's professional career.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

               <p>Offprints and reprints of articles by Sponer, spanning some thirty years of her career; a few late articles by James Franck; and articles from the early career of Sponer's friend and older colleague, Lise Meitner, perhaps the only German woman more prominent in physics than Sponer in the 1920s and 1930s. Meitner's folder contains a photostat of her historic January 16, 1939 "Letter to the Editor" from <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Nature,</title> in which she and Otto Frisch first explained the "new type of nuclear reaction" for which they suggested the name "fission." The final items in the series, a few issues of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Dog News,</title> shed light on the personal life of Sponer, who raised prize-winning Doberman Pinschers during her years in Durham. Also includes textbooks in both German and French.</p>

               <p>Research notes, correspondence, drafts of papers and speeches, lecture notes, and other materials that cover Sponer's professional career in the United States. Among other materials found here are her collaboration with Hedwig Kohn, discussed in the Collection Overview. The oldest materials in the collection appear at the end of this series--Sponer's handwritten, bound notebooks from lectures she attended as a graduate student at the University of Gottingen, 1918-1920. These document the early teaching and thought of several important faculty at Gottingen, including  her thesis advisor, Peter Debye, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1936. Arranged alphabetically, by topic or collaborator.</p>
