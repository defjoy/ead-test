         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>This collection of heterogeneous material, generally relating to the
		  colonial period of Peru, falls roughly into three groups centering around
		  commerce and industry, literary activity, and religious and social history.
		  Several manuscripts in the first group contain information on the mining of
		  mercury, 1786-1787. Literary materials include the poems of Caviedes in the
		  seventeenth century script useful for correcting errors in the copies published
		  by Ricardo Palma; a copy of iconoclastic and mysterious poems by Antonio de
		  Sol&#237;s; one cuaderno of the <emph render="underline">Documentos
		  hist&#243;ricos</emph> collected by Manuel de Odriozola; and three
		  <emph render="underline">Documentos literarios</emph> from contemporary
		  publications. Among the Items relating to religion and social history are a
		  compilation of the papers of Peruvian viceroys and others, 1580-1818; an
		  <emph render="underline">expediente</emph> concerning witchcraft and idolatry
		  in Peru; original papers on the modernization of learning which Charles III
		  attempted to impose upon the empire; copy of the proceso of Mariano Tupac
		  Amaru; and a booklet, 1794, describing the founding and development of Quito,
		  Ecuador.</p>
         
         <p>Some of these Items, formerly the property of Manuel de Odriozola, the
		  Peruvian literary historian who brought together this collection, are listed in
		  the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">C&#225;talogo de la Biblioteca Peruana Propiedad de Dn.
		  Francisco Perez de Velasco</title> (Lima, 1918). Rub&#233;n Vargas Ugarte, S. J.,
		describes some of these manuscripts in 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Manuscritos Peruanos en las Bibliotecas de
		  Am&#233;rica</title> (Buenos Aires, 1945, pp. 230-243) which is volume IV of his 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Biblioteca Peruana</title> (Lima, 1935- ). John
		Tate Lanning, James B. Duke Professor of History, also mentioned these
		manuscripts in his article "The Hispanic Collection" published in 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Gnomon, Essays for the Dedication of the William
		  R. Perkins Library</title> (Duke Unlversity, April 15 and 16, 1970).</p>
         
         <p>This guide to the collection is the result of extensive recataloging
		  in which, for the first time, considerable attention has been given to
		  analyzing the content of the manuscripts. The descriptions of many of the
		  manuscripts have been enlarged, and, in some cases, author and title
		  information has been changed or refined. Many entries have been added to the
		  card catalog based upon these new descriptions. Copies of these cards have been
		  included in this guide in order to provide additional means of access to the
		  contents of the collection.</p>

                  <p>The 
				purity of race 
                     (limpieza de sangre) was documented by
				testimonials demonstrating that the person was not a descendant of 
				Moors, 
                     Jews, 
                     heretics, or 
				penitenciados (persons punished by the Inquisition).
				  This documentation was a prerequisite in 
				Spain and its colonies in order to be admitted
				into a corporation, school or university, to practice a profession, or a trade,
				and to get married. A law of 
				May 16, 1865, abolished this requirement for marriage
				and for admission into the public service, and it was definitively abolished by
				the 27th article of the 
				1869 Constitution, and the 15th article of the 
				1876 Constitution (in force).</p>
                  
                  <p>This manuscript is an important source for the study of 
				social or economic discrimination against 
				racial or ethnic groups in 
				Spain and its colonies till the end of the 
				XIX century.

                  <p>This <emph render="underline">expediente</emph> contains two royal
				<emph render="underline">c&#233;dulas</emph> issued by 
				Charles III and 
				Charles IV, kings of 
				Spain and the 
				Indies. One <emph render="underline">c&#233;dula</emph> was issued on 
				June 25, 1783, at 
				Aranju&#233;z, and the other, on 
				Oct. 9, 1789, at 
				San Lorenzo del Real. In both
				<emph render="underline">c&#233;dulas</emph>, the 
				Bishop of Trujillo in 
				Peru, 
                     Don Baltasar J. Martinez Compa&#241;&#243;n, is ordered
				not to relent on his work of converting the 
				Indians into the 
				Christian faith. This <emph render="underline">expediente</emph> also contains an edict of the Bishop and
				correspondence between him and others under his jurisdiction in relation to the
				same matter (ff. 1-10). This manuscript is notable because most of its contents
				are the original records of a 
				trial for witchcraft and idolatry conducted
				against 
				Salvador Bautista, 
                     Nicol&#225;s Bautista, 
                     Juli&#225;n Bautista, 
                     Margarita Chuquipul (Salvador's wife), 
				Petrona Huilca (Nicol&#225;s's wife), and 
				Mar&#237;a Paysic. 
                     Ju&#225;n de Roxas, priest and vicar of the
				<emph render="underline">Doctrina</emph> of 
				At&#250;n Luya, was the acting judge and 
				Blas de la Encidna was the acting notary (ff.
				11-188). The trial began on 
				Feb. 28, 1789, and the last record dated was 
				July 9, 1790. It took place at the
				<emph render="underline">asiento</emph> of 
				San Ju&#225;n de Lam&#250;d, but the defendants were
				from 
				San Pedro de Cuemal. Between 
				March 3 and May 11, 1789, 55 witnesses were examined;
				they were relatives and neighbors of the defendants and almost all of them
				certified their depositions (ff. 15-120). Confessions were taken from the
				defendants (ff. 120-150), and the prosecution and the defense presented their
				petitions (ff. 151-156). The sentence was pronounced on 
				June 3, 1789 (ff. 157-158). The Royal Justice
				sentenced 
				Salvador and Nicol&#225;s Bautista and 
				Maria Pays&#237;c to be whipped through the streets
				over a packsaddle, with a coronet on their heads and their backs naked. 
				Petrona Huilca, 
                     Margarita Chuquipul, and 
				Juli&#225;n Bautista were sentenced to be
				feathered, to wear a coronet on their heads, and to serve as shield-bearers of
				the other offenders, their punishment being left to the discretion of the
				executioner. While the sentence was publicly performed, all the idols and
				instruments used by the defendants in their rites were thrown into a bonfire.
				Immediately they were expatriated to the 
				Province of Caxamarca, confined to a house of
				correction in perpetuity, and obliged to do hard work with rations but without
				salary for a landowner who would provide them with the necessary prisons until
				their death. Their houses were demolished and exorcised, and great crosses were
				placed on the lots and on the caves, rocks, and temples they had used for their
				rites.</p>
                  
                  <p>The expediente includes the estimates of the cost of the trial (f.
				165), the inventory, valuation, and the sale by public auction of the
				properties of

                  <p>This original manuscript is a register of goods exported in ships
				from the port of 
				Callao, Per&#250;, to 
				Spain and other ports of the 
				Southern Sea during 
				1774. Names of the owners or shippers of the goods,
				dates of registration, names of the ships, descriptions of the goods, ports of
				destination, names of the persons to whom the goods are sent, numbers of the
				invoices and the value of the goods are specified. The first pages include an
				index by the first name of the shippers. On the last two pages of the volume
				there is a summary of the invoices included in this book with an estimate of
				the value of the goods. This manuscript is an important source of information
				on commerce and shipping in 
				Per&#250; during 
				1774.

				Per&#250; examined since 
				1680, the year in which the 
				Licenciado Don Francisco de Xauregui was
				appointed <emph render="underline">Visitador de Capellan&#237;as</emph>. The
				<emph render="underline">capellan&#237;a</emph>, or 
				chaplaincy, was capital, the interest of which
				was required by 
				Spanish law for the support of an ecclesiastic
				whose duties were to celebrate masses and to perform other pious obligations.
				The r&#233;sum&#233;s include information about the nature, purposes, and duties imposed
				by the founders of the <emph render="underline">capellan&#237;as</emph>, the persons
				that possessed them in full right or on an interim basis, and the patrons
				responsible for the appointments. The <emph render="underline">capellan&#237;as</emph> described in this
				<emph render="underline">prontuario</emph> were founded between 
				1564 (f. 120) and 
				1683 (f. 211). Notations added to the original r&#233;sum&#233;s
				date as late as 
				1718 (f. 231).</p>

                  <p>The dates of the <emph render="underline">capellan&#237;as</emph> and

                  <p>This volume was ordered to be bound in

                     <emph render="underline">Archivero de la Curia Eclesiastica and Colector del Donativo
				Eclesiastico Voluntario</emph>. This event was apparently provoked by changes
				in the 
				Spanish law that prohibited the foundation of
				new <emph render="underline">capellan&#237;as</emph> and ordered the incorporation
				of their properties to the government treasury during 
				1820 and 
				1821. This legislation was cancelled in

                     Lircay River, near Talca, Chile. Copy, 
				ca. 1814. 3 pages.</p>
                  
                  <p>The agreement was reached the
				 3rd of May, 1814, on the banks of the 
				Lircay River near the city of 
				Talca. It was signed by the general in chief
				of the national army, 
				Brigadier Gabino Gainza and the principal
				chiefs of the army of the government of 
				Chile, 
                     Generals Bernardo O'Higgins and 
				Juan Mackenna. In this agreement 
				Chile offered to send deputies to the 
				Cortes as its representatives, and as an
				integral part of the 
				Spanish monarchy; to recognize 
				Ferdinand VII as its monarch, and the Regency
				that approved the 
				Junta of Chile, that will act as interior
				government with all its power and faculties. 
				Chile would have free commerce with the allied
				and the neutral nations, especially with 
				Great Britain. The royalist army would
				evacuate Chilean territory, ending the hostilities; and properties confiscated
				after 
				February of 1810 would be restored.</p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Don Jos&#233; Abascal, Viceroy of Per&#250;, disapproved
				the agreement and sent to 
				Chile another expedition in 
				July, 1814, that undertook the campaign that ended
				with the 
				Battle of Rancagua, retaining 
				Chile under Spanish domain till 
				1824.

                  <p>The paper on which the agreement is written was made in 
				Capellades, Catalonia, Spain, by the 
				Almirall family who produced paper there for a
				long period of time. Three examples of their work are illustrated and discussed
				in

				1804-1824, and those of 
				1807 and 
				1809 most closely resemble the watermarks on the
				manuscript. These facts suggest that the paper on which this copy of the
				agreement is written and the copy itself are reasonably contemporary with the
				signing of the agreement in 
				1814. This copy of the agreement differs from the one
				published in the second volume of 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Archivo de don Bernardo O'Higgins</title>
                     (Santiago de Chile, 
                     1947), pp. 156-159. Some words are missing, and others

			 South America during that period, for example
			 the signatures of 
			 O'Higgins and

                  <p>This manuscript was written to be delivered into the hands of 
				Jos&#233; de San Martin, as is stated in its first
				page. It is a geographic description of the

                     Per&#250;. It includes information on towns,
				population, courts, buildings, and describes the political, military, and

                     San Martin proclaimed the independence of 
				Per&#250; on 
				July 28, 1821, assuming the title of
				<emph render="doublequote">Protector</emph>. He held the protectorship and military
				command until 
				September, 1822, when he resigned and relinguished
				power to the new 
				Peruvian Congress. These facts suggest that
				this description was written during the period of the protectorship and is
				either an original or a copy contemporary with the years 
				1821-1822.

				Franciscan missionary expedition to 
				Manoa in El Dorado territory where the 
				Indians were revolting during the year 
				1767. He had a name similar to the eminent

				gold or silver, and goods and ornaments of the 
				chapels of Santa Ana and Santa Isabel in that
				church. There is a note at the end explaining that the inventory of the goods
				and ornaments of the altar of 
				Nuestra Se&#241;ora de la Antigua is not included
				because they are the property of the 
				University of San Marcos. The University uses
				that altar to deliver the major degrees in public ceremony. The inventories

				Ricardo Palma brought out a later edition of
				the poetry of 
				Ju&#225;n del Valle y Caviedes based on a
				manuscript copy from the library of 
				Cipriano Coronel Zegarra. The manuscript copy,
				here in the Peruvian Collection, written at the second half of the 
				17th century, of the poems of 
				Caviedes was very useful for correcting errors
				in the copies published by 
				Ricardo Palma. It includes more than sixty
				unpublished 
				sonnets and many other unedited 
				poems of 
				Caviedes. Copies of his poems are preceded by

                  <p>The <emph render="underline">Concilio Provincial</emph> is an
				assembly of the 
				clergy of an 
				ecclesiastical province gathered to deliberate
				upon points of doctrine and discipline of the 
				Catholic religion. The decisions approved by
				these councils are an important source of 
				canon law in the 
				Catholic Church. This manuscript of more than
				1,000 pages contains 49 opinions handed down by the consultants that
				participated in the <emph render="underline">Concilio Provincial</emph> that
				took place in 
				Lima, Per&#250;, during 
				1772-1773. This was the last <emph render="underline">Concilio</emph> that took place in 
				Lima under the 
				Spanish rule. The Archbishopric of 
				Lima was highly interested in obtaining this
				manuscript from the owners of the 
				P&#233;rez de Velasco collection to whom they made
				a very substantial offer. This manuscript is an excellent source of information
				for researchers interested in the study of the history of the 
				Catholic Church in 
				Spanish America, and of the treatment given to
				the Indians by the 
				Catholic Church during the 
				colonial period.

                  <p>This original manuscript records the inspections of the warehouse
				by the interventor or comptroller 
				Juan de Luque Marmol, to verify the amount of 
				mercury and of 
				dressed sheepskins used as containers for the 
				mercury between 
				Jan. 1st and Dec. 31st, 1786. Information about the
				dates of arrivals and departures from the warehouses, the weight, geographical
				sources, names of the owners or shippers of the 
				mercury and the 
				sheepskins are specified in the inspections done
				during that year. 
				Francisco Argumaniz was the guard of the
				warehouses during that period. Pages are missing from the volume, but it
				contains all of the information specified in the index. This volume is a good
				source of information on 
				mercury production in 
				Per&#250;, similar to MS. No. 3 of this
				collection.</p>

                     Basadre's letter to 
				Jose de G&#225;lvez concerned 
				trade with China, the 
				discovery of mines in New Spain, and the 
				importation of mercury from the 
				Philippines through the port of 
				Acapulco. 
                     Basadre proposed the establishment with 
				Chinese merchants of an exchange of 
				mercury for 
				furs. 
                     Nutria and seal furs were available from the

				Charles Marie de la Condamine from 
				Quito, Ecuador, to 
				Paris, France, by the way of the 
				Maran&#243;n and 
				Amazon rivers, containing data on latitude,
				longitude, velocity of river currents, width, and depth of streams, and
				observations on altitude. 
				La Condamine had come to 
				America with representatives of the 
				French Academy of Sciences, and with 
				Antonio de Ull&#243;a and 
				Jorge Ju&#225;n, scientists representing the 
				King of Spain, to measure a degree at the 
				equator to determine the shape of the 
				earth. This was the expedition which proved
				that the poles were not round and silenced the enemies of 
				Newton. 
                     La Condamine left the southernmost point of
				his 
				meridian measurement on 
				May 11, 1743, and reached 
				Paris, 
                     Feb. 23, 1745. The author of this summary is not

				Franciscan Fr. Paulo Alonso Carvallo, guardian
				and vicar of the 
				Missionary College of Santa Rosa de Ocopa in 
				Per&#250;, together with 
				Fr. Diego Ruiz and others. The purpose was to
				restore the missions of
