         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Stirewalt Family Papers, 1828-1993 (bulk 1850-1947), are comprised of the personal papers of individuals from four successive generations of the Stirewalt family. The correspondence, writings, diaries, legal/financial documents, photographs, and other miscellaneous papers found in this collection document the Stirewalt Family's personal lives and involvement in the Lutheran Church as ministers, educators and missionaries. The collection is divided into four primary series which reflect the individuals whose papers make up this collection: Jacob Stirewalt, Jerome Paul Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt, and Catherine A. Stirewalt. The arrangement of the collection is primarily chronological, following the lineage of the Stirewalt family. Subsections within each major series are determined by the type of materials found within the collection and are arranged either chronologically, as in the case of the Diaries and Correspondence Subseries, or alphabetically and thereunder chronologically, as in the case of the Writings Subseries.</p>
         
         <p>The Stirewalt family is descended from Jacob Stirewalt, a minister and member of the Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Jacob Stirewalt was primarily active in and around New Market, Va. and Rowan and Shenandoah counties in Virginia. The Subseries related to Jacob Stirewalt includes Correspondence from 1828-1858, Writings (primarily sermons and sermon outlines in German and English) from the 1830s to the 1860s, and Diaries, which includes a Memorandum book where he recorded financial transactions and other records of his career as a minister from 1834 to his death in 1869.</p>
         
         <p>Jerome Paul Stirewalt, the son of Jacob Stirewalt, was also a minister and a leader of the Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. He served as a minister in several pastorates in Virginia and North Carolina and several terms as president, secretary, and treasurer of the Tennessee Synod in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His papers are primarily composed of Correspondence, 1870-1933, with other ministers, relating to the business of the Tennessee Synod, and with family members. The collection also includes Jerome Paul Stirewalt's Writings, primarily sermons and sermon outlines, and other miscellaneous financial and legal papers. The Diaries Subseries is primarily memorandum books which list the date and location of religious services performed and the topic or title of sermons delivered by J.P. Stirewalt. These books serve to provide a record of Stirewalt's work as a Lutheran minister.</p>
         
         <p>Martin Luther Stirewalt, the son of Jerome Paul Stirewalt, was also a Lutheran minister and educator at Lutheran schools and colleges in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Chicago, Ill. This series includes correspondence, diaries, writings and clippings which provide a picture of Stirewalt's theological education, activities as a minister and educator, and insights into his personal life and familial relationships. </p>
         
         <p>The papers of Catherine A Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt's daughter, are primarily correspondence written while she was a Lutheran Missionary in China from 1939-1949. This correspondence provides documentation of the Lutheran Church's activities in China prior to and after World War II. Catherine Stirewalt's letters provide a great deal of detail about the daily lives of missionaries in China and some information about the lives of the Chinese people working as instructors or attending the mission school. There is no correspondence from the period of the first two years of World War II when she was interned in the Weihsien concentration camp near Tsingtao, China. Other miscellaneous clippings, photographs, and writings in this series provide further documentation of her experiences in China.</p>

Many of the letters seem to refer to the solicitation of funds for special projects being undertaken by the Synod and to financial compensations being provided by the Synod to member ministers. The collection also includes some personal correspondence, business correspondence not related to the activities of the Tennessee Synod, and several drafts of letters written by Stirewalt between<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1911</unitdate>and<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1912.</unitdate>Also included is a small amount of correspondence received by William J. Stirewalt.

                  <p>The chronologically arranged Writings Subseries primarily consists of sermons and sermon outlines, the bulk of which appear to be outlines which Stirewalt used as references while delivering the sermons. Most of the sermons are dated and the location where each was written, primarily New Market, Va., is given. The outlines are very detailed, providing titles, and references to biblical texts cited by the sermon or used as evidence to support the theme of the sermon. Three folders of undated sermons are filed at the end of this subseries. </p>

                  <p>The Writings Subseries is arranged in loosely chronological order and consists of Martin Luther Stirewalt's early religious and professional writings. The subseries is composed of notebooks containing coursework and religious essays written while a student at the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, later student essays, sermons and speeches, and notes and drafts for other religious and professional writings. Many of the sermons included in this subseries appear to have been developed and compiled by Stirewalt as guides to sermon writing and were possibly used as curriculums for courses he taught.</p>

                  <p>The chronologically arranged Correspondence Subseries consists of letters written by Catherine Stirewalt to her family and friends during her time spent working and studying in China. In her letters she discusses her day to day life in China, the progress of her studies of the Chinese language, and the details of sightseeing trips made near Tsingtao, China. The letters begin in<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1939,</unitdate>just prior to her departure for China, and continue on a weekly basis through December of<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1941</unitdate>and the beginning of World War II. Her correspondence resumes after her release from a Japanese concentration camp in<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1943</unitdate>and continues through her return to China in July of<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1947</unitdate>and subsequent evacuation from China after the Communists came to power in<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1949.</unitdate>Her letters from immediately after her<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1943</unitdate>repatriation include notes written during the difficult five-week sea journey that she made on her return to the United States. The letters from her second stay in China provide a detailed picture of the difficult living conditions for the Chinese people following WWII. She discusses how inflation and scarcity of food and other supplies affected the region of China where she had been working. She also discusses the difficult living conditions of the missionaries and the problems they had performing their work. Her letters in<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1949</unitdate>discuss the political situation in China, her struggles with making a decision to stay in China, and the day to day lives of the missionaries with whom she is working. There is a gap in correspondence from May of<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1949</unitdate>until<unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1987</unitdate>when the correspondence series continues with letters Miss Stirewalt received from her friends and former students in China.</p>
