         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>In late July 1981, Terry Sanford initiated
		  negotiations with former president Richard Nixon (Duke Law
		  1937) to locate the Nixon presidential library on the
		  campus of his alma mater. When this information was
		  revealed to faculty members during the week of August 10,
		  1981, many opposed the proposition as well as Sanford's
		  failure to consult the faculty prior to initiating
		  negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>Many who opposed the library had moral objections
		  to memorializing a president whose behavior in office was
		  reproachable, and they feared a negative effect on the
		  university's reputation. Other concerns included the
		  effects of greatly increased tourist traffic on campus and
		  the aesthetic nature of the large proposed structure.
		  However, supporters of erecting the Nixon Library on campus
		  argued that the scholarly and academic benefits of locating
		  the vast Nixon Presidential Materials collection on campus
		  should and would outweigh any moral concerns. These
		  supporters tended to denounce the actions of vocal
		  dissenters as divisive and/or arrogant.</p>
         
         <p>Meetings of the Academic Council and Board of
		  Trustees during September and October 1981 were dominated
		  by this debate, and a group of faculty formed the Committee
		  Against the Nixon-Duke Library (CANDL) to organize the
		  efforts of faculty, students, alumni, and others opposed to
		  the proposed library. Although the Academic Council voted
		  not to recommend further negotiations with Nixon in a 35-34
		  decision September 3, 1981, the Board of Trustees later
		  voted 9-2 to proceed. By April 1982 negotiations had
		  stalled, and a year later Nixon's representatives announced
		  that a site at Chapman College in San Clemente, California,
		  had been chosen for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential
		  Library.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         
         <p>The bulk of dated materials from the Committee
		  Against the Nixon-Duke Library spans the months of
		  September through December 1981. The collection is composed
		  primarily of correspondence, including the personal
		  correspondence of Ruffin Slater and Prof. Norman Guttman,
		  both on the CANDL Coordinating Committee, as well as active
		  CANDL member Prof. J. David Barber. It also contains two
		  folders of correspondence to the Committee, separated into
		  letters of support for CANDL and letters of opposition to
		  the Committee's goals. It contains one folder of
		  confidential correspondence to Duke President Terry
		  Sanford.</p>
         
         <p>The CANDL Records also contain some letter and
		  advertisement drafts, as well handwritten notes on a
		  variety on subjects, all of an unidentified author, most
		  probably Slater or Guttman.</p>
         
         <p>The collection also contains letters mailed to
		  faculty and alumni soliciting membership and donations, as
		  well as periodic updates sent to CANDL members.
		  Advertisements placed in local papers and flyers posted on
		  campus are also included, as well as a humorous Watergate
		  coloring book used to construct these ads.</p>
         
         <p>Membership information is organized into two
		  folders. Faculty membership lists are arranged
		  chronologically and are frequently divided into
		  departmental lists.</p>
         
         <p>Financial Records are limited to incomplete
		  handwritten expenditure and donation lists and a receipt
		  from The Chronicle significant for its complete list of ads
		  placed by CANDL in the campus newspaper.</p>
         
         <p>This collection also contains one folder of
		  brochures and publications from other presidential
		  libraries and museums, all ca. 1981, not duplicated in the
		  Nixon Library Controversy Collection.</p>
         
         <p>For additional information, see also the Nixon
		  Library Controversy Collection.</p>
