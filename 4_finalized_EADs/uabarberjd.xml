            <p>James David Barber was born in 1930 in Charleston, W. Va. and went on to receive his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. from Yale University. After teaching at Yale for several years, he joined the faculty of Duke's Political Science Department as Chair in 1972.  Barber was well known as a presidential scholar and published numerous books including <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Presidential Character: Predicting Performance in the White House</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Pulse of Politics: Electing Presidents in the Media Age</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Politics by Humans: Research on American Leadership</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Book of Democracy</title>. He served as chair of Amnesty International U.S.A. during the mid-1980s. He remained a community activist in Durham after his retirement from Duke in 1995, helping to raise money for various causes.  He died in 2004 at the age of 74.

            <p>Entitled "My Life," the scrapbook contains nine sections: My Main Vita, My Books, Professors Blessing Me, My Early Life, My Teaching, My Work to Help Duke University, My Coming Forth for Politics, Some Things I Have Done for Humans, and Pictures.

Also included are typescripts of Barber's "What Duke Can Be" and "Duke's Constitution," letters to Barber upon his retirement from Duke and family pictures.  </p>
            
            <p>This scrapbook is a xerox copy made by James David Barber in 1996 (includes color scans). The original remains with his family.</p>
