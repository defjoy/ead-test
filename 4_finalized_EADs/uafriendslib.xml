         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Friends of the Duke University Library promote
		  understanding and gather financial support of the work of
		  the Duke University Libraries. The Friends host serveral
		  events to highlight the scholarship, community, and
		  fellowship within the Duke University Library system. The
		  Engaging Faculty Series of four lectures each academic year
		  features interdisciplinary conversations with Duke faculty
		  scholars. Friends' Dinner and Annual Meeting, held each
		  spring, has included Duke parents and contemporary authors.
		  The Friends also hold occasional book sales to benefit the
		  Preservation Endowment.</p>
         
         <p>Many of the Friends of the Library events focus on
		  students. In alternate years, the Friends of the Library
		  and the Gothic Bookshop co-sponsor an essay contest and a
		  book collectors contest, which are open to undergraduates
		  and graduate students. The Lionel Stevenson Essay contest
		  honors the memory of a member of the English faculty, and
		  rewards the writer of the best essay with a Gothic Bookshop
		  gift certificate. The Jeremy North Book Collectors Contest,
		  named for the first manager of the Gothic Bookshop,
		  recognizes the efforts of student book collectors with a
		  prize in both an undergraduate and a graduate category.
		  Each semester the Friends host a study break in the Perkins
		  Library lobby during exams, serving baked goods contributed
		  by members. About 200 students attend the study break each
		  semester.</p>
         
         <p> A contribution to any library fund benefits the
		  library and confers membership in the Friends. However,
		  several funds are directed exclusively to Friends projects
		  and activities: Friends Book Fund, Preservation Endowment,
		  and Unrestricted Friends Support. The Friends Book Fund is
		  used to make major acquisitions for the library's
		  collections. With the Friends Book Fund the library
		  typically purchases resources that will support
		  interdisciplinary research or that will enrich collections
		  being developed in response to the establishment of new
		  academic programs. The Friends Book Fund has underwritten
		  the acquisition of an array of resources, including
		  materials to support special research needs of faculty, art
		  books for the Lilly Library, significant electronic
		  resources such as HarpWeek, CDs for the Music Media Center,
		  and books on various subjects for the Perkins circulating
		  collection. The Friends Preservation Endowment supports the
		  library's program to preserve its collections for the use
		  of current and future generations of students and scholars.
		  Gifts to the Unrestricted Friends Support funds underwrite
		  programming, occasional publications, and other activities
		  that further the outreach efforts of the Friends of the
		  Duke University Libraries. </p>
         
         <p>The Duke University Friends of the Library is run
		  by seven-member Executive Committee and one student
		  representative. The student representative is elected for a
		  term of two years. The University Librarian is also an
		  ex-officio voting member.</p>
         
         <p>The libraries of Duke University consist of the
		  William R. Perkins Library and its seven branches on
		  campus: Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry,
		  Lilly, Engineering, Music, Mathematics-Physics, Special
		  Collections; the Pearse Memorial Library at the Duke Marine
		  Laboratory in Beaufort; and the independently administered
		  libraries of Divinity, Law, Medicine, and Business (Ford
		  Library). As of June 1996, these libraries contained over
		  4,534,000 volumes. The collection includes eleven million
		  manuscripts, and over two million public documents. The
		  Libraries are directed by the Vice Provost for Library
		  Affairs. </p>
