               <p>This scrapbook contains photographs from Breece's life as a Duke student from 1935-1939. Included are scenes of May Day celebrations, the Duke Gardens, Duke's 100th anniversary celebration, homecoming parades (with Duke Home alumni float that resembles Duke Chapel), Flag Raising, the 1939 Senior Style Show, and snapshots of William Preston Few and Mary Duke Biddle.  Many of the photographs feature Breece and her friends in candid shots in dorm rooms and outside of various campus buildings and faculty apartments.  There are images of Woman's College students doing archery and visiting the area around President Few's home as well as the marching band and construction pictures of the graduate dorm. Of note is a picture of an African-American housekeeper from the Woman's College named Jennie and two other shots of where African-American children appear.  There are also some images of Breece with her family and pets. Arranged approximately by date (in original page order). The images are largely identified. </p>
