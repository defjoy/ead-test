In 1936, he became President of Durham Realty Company (now Southland Associates, Inc.). During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as a Lieutenant Commander. Upon return, he established Whitehall Furniture, where he worked until 1961. He then worked at Erwin and Co., Inc., a local bond house, for a decade. In 1971, he joined Harris Upham, a brokerage house, before finishing out his career as an account executive of Smith Barney.
