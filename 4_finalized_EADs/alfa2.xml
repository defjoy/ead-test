         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance (ALFA) was founded in 1972 by a group of radical lesbians, many socialist and all feminist, who broke away from Atlanta's Women's Liberation Center and the Gay Liberation movement because they felt that neither had adequately addressed issues of concern to women as lesbians and lesbians as women. ALFA initially worked to fill a social void for and to offer a political voice to Atlanta lesbians, publicizing its efforts through a self-produced monthly newsletter, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Atalanta.</title> Over the years, as the political and cultural climate changed and lesbians created new avenues through which to pursue their interests, ALFA struggled to find a clear and unique sense of purpose; this historically telling struggle is well-documented by ALFA itself, in minutes and mailings to its membership. In spite of its eventual decision to disband, ALFA remains known as one of the oldest lesbian feminist organizations in the United States, and a pioneer in the fight for lesbian, gay, and women's rights.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The ALFA Archives include the organizational records of ALFA as well as other southern radical women's groups. This addition to the ALFA Archives, transferred to the Duke David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library in May, 1998, documents the financial operations of ALFA as well as providing information about the fund raising endeavors of the organization. The banking records, legal papers, and minutes from finance committee meetings provide documentation of the struggles of the organization to remain financially viable and to raise money in support of various women's issues. The financial and legal records relating to the property owned by ALFA serve to document the organization's attempt to provide a physical center around which Atlanta's lesbians and feminists could congregate and develop a mutually supportive community. This addition has not been processed but is open for use.</p>
