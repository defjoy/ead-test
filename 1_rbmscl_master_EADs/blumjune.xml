<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Quoted from Blum's website:</p>
<p>An artist and pioneer in getting women artists and their works exhibited in mainstream museums, June Blum was in the forefront of the women's art movement in NYC in the late 1960s and early l970s. Her <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Female President Light Event</title> (l968-1969) helped raise the awareness of Long Island, N.Y., artists and residents. As Curator of Contemporary Art at the Suffolk Museum, Stony Brook, N.Y. (l971-1975), she created the exhibit <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Unmanly Art,</title> the first in-house Museum-curated exhibit of women artists (1971-1972). Blum also coordinated <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Works on Paper,</title> a show for women artists at the Brooklyn Museum (1975), and began a series of portraits of women prominent in feminist circles, including Alice Neel and Betty Friedan (painted in 1977 as part of the Sister Chapel project). In 1975 she formed Women Artists Living in Brooklyn, and was a juror for the exhibit <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Washington to Washington,</title> held at the National Museum of Women in the Arts. In 1980, Blum formed the East Central Women's Caucus for Art, and initiated women's exhibits around the country. Blum, whose works have been exhibited nationwide, studied at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn Museum Art School, The Pratt Graphic Art Center, and the New School of Social Research. She created Women for Art to publish catalogs, and was a member of the N.Y. Professional Women Artists group. In addition, she was an original artist and member of the all-women Central Hall Artists Gallery. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2003 for her role in advancing the study of women in the arts.</p>
