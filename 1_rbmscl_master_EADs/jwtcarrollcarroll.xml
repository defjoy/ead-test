<p>Carroll Carroll grew up in Harlem, Buffalo, and Chicago. After graduating from Chicago's Hyde Park High School, he started work as chief copy writer at the advertising agency of Sigmund Tann, and stayed five years. Beginning in 1926, he worked as a freelance writer for several publications: the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">New Yorker,</title> <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Life,</title> <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Judge,</title> <title render="italic" linktype="simple">College Humor,</title> the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Saturday Evening Post,</title> and the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">New York World</title>. He also ran a column in the magazine <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Canada Goblin,</title> wrote review sketches for <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Garrick Gaieties,</title> and was under contract to T. B. Harms as a lyric writer. For several years, he also contributed a rhymed motion picture review called <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Cinemetric Review</title> to the Monday evening edition of <title render="italic" linktype="simple">New York Evening Sun</title>.</p>

<p>In 1932, Carroll joined JWT, and subsequently went on the road with a JWT radio program featuring <persname>George Burns</persname>, <persname>Gracie Allen</persname> and <persname>Guy Lombardo</persname>. He eventually became Editorial Supervisor of all JWT radio shows, and helped produce many JWT comedy and variety shows, including <corpname>Chase &amp; Sanborn</corpname> with Eddie Cantor. During his tenure at the JWT New York office, he also created and wrote a full hour variety program with <persname>Al Jolson</persname> known as <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Shell Chateau,</title> and collaborated on the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Rudy Vallee Hour.</title> In 1934, he created and wrote the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Kraft Music Hall,</title> when it featured <persname>Paul Whiteman</persname> and <persname>Deems Taylor</persname>, and moved to Los Angeles to continue it when <persname>Bing Crosby</persname> took over. In Hollywood, he wrote radio shows for <corpname>Kraft</corpname>, <corpname>Ford</corpname>, <corpname>Shell</corpname>, <corpname>Old Gold</corpname>, <corpname>Elgin</corpname>, <corpname>Swift</corpname>, <corpname>Lux</corpname> and <corpname>Standard Brands</corpname>.</p>

<p>In 1946, Carroll left JWT to become Vice President in charge of the Hollywood office of the <corpname>Ward Wheelock Advertising Agency</corpname>; there, he wrote and produced radio shows for <persname>Bob Crosby</persname> and <persname>Walter O'Keefe</persname>. He returned to JWT at the New York office in 1957. At that point, he produced three <corpname>Chase &amp; Sanborn</corpname> hour-long NBC specials for radio, worked with print and broadcast advertising for accounts of <corpname>Kodak</corpname>, <corpname>Shell</corpname>, <corpname>Listerine</corpname>, <corpname>Ford</corpname>, <corpname>Lever Brothers</corpname>, <corpname>Liggett &amp; Myers</corpname>, <corpname>American Petroleum Institute</corpname>, <corpname>Irving Trust Company</corpname>, and <corpname>Warner-Lambert</corpname>.</p>

<p>Carroll also ghost-wrote two books for <persname>Bob Hope</persname>: <title render="italic" linktype="simple">I Never Left Home</title>; and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">So This Is Peace</title>; and wrote the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Lux Radio Theatre</title> adaptation of <title render="italic" linktype="simple">I Never Left Home.</title> He created many television specials, including the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Judy Garland Special</title> and the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">20th Century Fox Hour.</title> He retired from JWT in 1968.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Biographical Sketch from Original Finding Aid</emph></p>
<p>In a letter to <emph render="italic">Variety</emph> editor Abel Green on Dec. 20, 1946, Carroll Carroll (1902-) defended the role of advertising men in radio.  Responding to the frequent suggestion that responsibility for radio ought to return to the <emph render="doublequote">showmen,</emph> Carroll wrote: <emph render="doublequote">National advertisers and their agents do, today, exercise about 90% of the showmanship in radio...they would not be doing this if they were not better showmen <emph render="italic">and</emph> business men than those from whom they took over.</emph> A showman himself, Carroll's opinions are based on fourteen years of experience as a writer for some of the most popular radio programs of the day. He was involved with the young medium of radio when advertising personnel were largely responsible for the development, writing, and production of programs.</p>
<p>Becoming a member of the Broadcasting Department of the J. Walter Thompson Company in 1932, Carroll immediately went on the road with the <emph render="doublequote">Burns and Allen--Guy Lombardo</emph> program, an association which lasted for several years. During radio's golden age, Carroll Carroll was involved with all of J. Walter Thompson Company's comedy and variety shows, including: the <emph render="doublequote">Chase and Sanborn Hour</emph>; the <emph render="doublequote">Rudy Vallee Hour</emph>; and <emph render="doublequote">Shell Chateau.</emph> He worked with such stars as Eddie Cantor, Joe Penner, Al Jolson, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.</p>
<p>In 1934 Carroll Carroll created and wrote the <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall</emph> featuring Paul Whiteman.  When the program moved to Hollywood and Bing Crosby assumed the starring role in 1936, Carroll also moved west and took charge. For the next ten years he wrote for the <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall,</emph> establishing a continuity of programming that made Crosby's style familiar and likeable--the essential factors, Carroll maintained, to the program's success.</p>
<p>During World War II <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall</emph> became a vehicle through which the government programs and policies were regularly announced. Participation in the war effort included the promotion of War Bonds, the Junior Red Cross, and WAAC enlistment.  Credit for <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall's</emph> role in providing the American people with information about the War and encouraging enthusiasm for government campaigns, was given to Bing Crosby and Carroll Carroll.  In addition to writing the scripts for <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall,</emph> Carroll became a consultant to the Office of War Information on Oct. 28, 1942; was on the Writers' War Board; and in 1946 became a member of its successor organization, the Writers' Board.</p>
<p>Carroll Carroll did not limit himself to radio. He also wrote magazine articles, reviews, and ghosted for celebrities.  Among his anonymous books are Bob Hope's <emph render="italic">I Never Left Home</emph> and <emph render="italic">So This is Peace</emph>. Upon retirement from J. Walter Thompson in 1968 he wrote a column for Variety on television advertisement and continued to write about the early days of radio.</p>

<head>Collection Arrangement</head>

<p> The collection is organized into six series: <emph render="bold">General Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>; <emph render="bold">Scripts</emph>; <emph render="bold">Speeches</emph>; <emph render="bold">Interviews</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Sheet music</emph>. The <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> include miscellaneous memoranda, newsletters, flyers and thumbnail biographical sketches of JWT accumulated during his second tenure at the company's New York office.</p>

</arrangement>

<p><emph render="bold">General Files</emph> were taken from a folder of miscellaneous memoranda and newsletters. Biographical materials were placed in a separate folder. The correspondence files arrived already foldered, labeled and arranged chronologically. Folders were replaced, but labels and order were retained. The scripts and speeches music arrived in unlabeled folders or bound and labeled report folders. Extended scripts and speeches in unlabeled folders were foldered and labeled according to title. Shorter scripts were placed in a folder of miscellaneous scripts. Scripts in bound report folders were removed from binding and placed in individual folders, with original labels retained. Sheet music arrived in one folder, with no obvious arrangement. Musical materials were foldered by song, and arranged by author and date.</p>
