         <p>From
		  http://www.ee.duke.edu/graduate/abouteng.html</p>
         <p>The School of Engineering traces its history back
		  to 1851 when the catalogue for Normal College, the
		  forerunner of Trinity College and Duke University,
		  advertised a Classical course which included surveying in
		  the sophomore year as well as architecture and engineering
		  for seniors. Similar offerings characterized instruction in
		  the subject of engineering throughout the 73 year period of
		  the institution's operation as Trinity College. When
		  Trinity College because Duke University in 1924,
		  Engineering instruction underwent a period of vigorous
		  development.</p>
         <p>The School of Engineering at Duke is currently
		  primarily housed in its own two buildings: Hudson Hall
		  (fondly known as Old Red) and the modern Teer Building. It
		  also shares space with other science facilities in the
		  Levine Science Research Center which is separate from the
		  Engineering Buildings. The School of Engineering is
		  composed of the four departments of Electrical and Computer
		  Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil and
		  Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering and
		  Materials Science. There are also shared research
		  facilities and joint research activities with numerous
		  other departments including Physics, Computer Science,
		  Mathematics and Medicine.</p>
         <p>The School of Engineering houses the prestigious
		  National Science Foundation Center for Advanced
		  Cardiovascular Technology, which is an international leader
		  in the application of Engineering to Medicine, and the
		  Vesic Engineering Library in the Teer Building.</p>
