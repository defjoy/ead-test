         <p>The Duke University Department of Anthropology was
		  formed in the 1972/1973 academic year, after the Department
		  of Sociology and Anthropology, which had existed from 1941
		  to 1972, split into two separate departments. In July 1988,
		  the disciplines in the Department of Anthropology divided
		  into the Department of Cultural Anthropology and the
		  Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy.</p>
         <p>The Duke Department of Cultural Anthropology
		  offered this description of its undergraduate course of
		  study in 2005: "Cultural anthropology focuses on the study
		  of cultures around the world. Understanding and living with
		  diversity is one of today's urgent challenges. Our planet
		  has grown much more interconnected... Cultural anthropology
		  is the discipline that studies how people create and
		  define... distinct ways of living... The discipline no
		  longer limits itself only to "primitive" lifeways, having
		  expanded to encompass the study of both non-Western and
		  Western societies. Topics of study now range from ethnic
		  and race relations to gender, sexuality, nationalism, law,
		  medicine, and popular culture. New methods and theories
		  have arisen to understand these complex phenomena,
		  influenced by such currents of thought as feminism,
		  postmodernism, political economy, cognitive science, and
		  psychoanalysis. Among the broad concerns of cultural
		  anthropology today are: Under what conditions is culture
		  invented? Under what conditions do cultural understandings
		  gain force, persist, and spread? How does culture intersect
		  with history, economics, and politics?"

		  the Anthropology Department included all cultural and
		  biological subdisciplines in one academic department. The
		  files include clippings and a newsletter, as well as a few
		  documents relating to the Anthropology Majors Union. In
		  addition, the records include a syllabus and selected
		  course papers from Cultural Anthropology 105.S01: Campus
		  Politics, taught by Orin Starn in 1992. Most of the course
		  papers focus on cultural phenomena at Duke University; some
		  papers are restricted, see below for details. </p>
