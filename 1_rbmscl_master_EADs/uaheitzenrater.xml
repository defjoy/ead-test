<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Richard Paul Heitzenrater entered Duke University in 1957. He graduated in 1961 with a degree in History and went on to earn a degree in Church History (1964) as well as a Ph.D. in Religion, History (1972) both from Duke. After earning his degrees Heitzenrater worked as an Associate Pastor at First United Methodist Church in Butler, Pennsylvania and held teaching jobs at Centre College as well as Southern Methodist University. In 1993 Heitzenrater returned to Duke and has since held the position of William Kellon Quick Professor of Church History and Wesley Studies. He has authored a number of books and is regarded as preeminent scholar on the life of John Wesley. However, Heitzenrater has been involved with much more than just academics while here at Duke. He is a gifted graphic artist and has created Christmas cards, event posters (with his brother Drew Heitzenrater), brochures, and various other printed materials. He also sings with the Duke Chapel Choir and has produced a number of DVDs documenting their performances.</p>
