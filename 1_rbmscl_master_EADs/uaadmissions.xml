         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>There is little written record of the early
		  administrative reporting relationships of admissions beyond
		  the following broad outline. When the Woman's College and
		  Trinity College were separate, the Dean of Admissions of
		  each school reported to the University Registrar, who
		  reported to the Vice President of the Educational Division
		  (now Provost). Each college may have had a committee on
		  admissions. In 1961 William Brinkley was named Director of
		  Admissions and probably Associate Registrar at the same
		  time. The separate Deans of Admissions reported to him. In
		  1967 Robert Ballantyne was named Director of Admissions,
		  and at this time, reporting shifted from the Registrar to
		  an officer in the Provost's Office. In 1969 he reported to
		  the Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education, James
		  Price. By 1975 that title had changed to Vice Provost and
		  Dean of Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. There was a
		  major reorganization and retirement of admissions personnel
		  with the merger of the Woman's College and Trinity College
		  as of July 1, 1972. In 1978 the Director of Admissions
		  appears to be reporting to an Assistant Provost with
		  responsibility for Admissions, Financial Aid and
		  Registration. In 1980 an organizational chart in a
		  University Report uses the term Assistant Provost for
		  Academic Support Services (Admission Records, Financial
		  Aid, Academic Systems, Placement). However, this title was
		  not found in a University Bulletin.</p>
