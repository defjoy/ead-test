		<bioghist> 
		  <p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) compiled and
			 held the materials that became this collection of poster designs (formerly
			 known as the Outdoor Advertising Sketch Library), but the card file and volumes
			 in this collection most likely originated within the outdoor advertising
			 companies represented, such as General Outdoor Advertising Co. and Foster and
			 Kleiser. OAAA is the primary professional and trade association representing
			 the outdoor advertising industry and was founded to promote outdoor advertising
			 interests in the United States. OAAA members own and operate billboards, street
			 furniture, transit, or other outdoor advertising displays. Members also include
			 service providers to the industry, users of the outdoor medium, and others
			 supporting its goals.</p>

		<head>Collection Overview</head> 
		<p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America Poster Designs are
		  comprised of black and white poster designs (for billboard or other transit
		  advertising), some printed on cards and some photographed and mounted in
		  volumes, that document the advertising design holdings of several outdoor
		  advertising companies from 1934 through the 1940s and possibly later. The
		  majority of the designs in the collection are stock posters in preliminary
		  sketch form with simple lines, but the collection also includes finished
		  designs with brief information on exhibition and award status. Stock designs
		  were created without actual brand names so more than one advertiser could use
		  them by simply inserting their own brand name or product into the ad. The
		  designs include work created or acquired by the Donaldson Lithographing Co.,
		  Foster and Kleiser, General Outdoor Advertising Co., and the AD-VER-TIS-ER,
		  Inc.</p> 
		<p> These designs provide a snapshot of American consumerism during the
		  interwar years by demonstrating how advertising professionals in the 1930s and
		  1940s represented products in order to entice shoppers. As well, the designs
		  document the production of commercial art during this time period, in both the
		  artistic process of creating ad artwork for billboards or other transit
		  advertising space, as well as in the relationship between ad agency and client.
		  Proven designs were available to the ad agency as sales tools to prospective
		  clients, and these stock images could be reused, so there was less need to
		  customize advertising campaigns for individual clients. The designs are
		  organized into two series: <emph render="bold">Printed Poster Designs
		  </emph>and <emph render="bold">Stock Poster Photograph Volumes</emph>.</p> 
		<p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Poster Designs Series</emph> consists
		  of a card file of designs including some more polished billboard images, all
		  arranged into product or service categories. The <emph render="bold">Stock
		  Poster Photograph Volumes Series</emph> consists of twelve volumes of designs,
		  also organized by product or service type. </p> 
		<p>Closely related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library include the Outdoor Advertising Slide Library; the John E.
		  Brennan Outdoor Advertising Survey Reports; the John Paver Papers; the John
		  Browning Papers; the Duplex Advertising Co. Records; the War Effort
		  Mobilization Campaigns Collection; the Outdoor Advertising Association of
		  America Records; the Garrett Orr Papers; the R.C. Maxwell Company Records; the
		  Howard Scott Papers; and the Strobridge Lithographing Company Photographs. </p>

			 <p>Consists mainly of black and white printed cards of billboard
				advertising designs. Most images are in a preliminary stage of design
				completion, and many are stock designs with no actual brand names appearing.
				Some, however, are more polished, containing added information about placement
				in competitions (e.g., Annual Exhibition of Outdoor Advertising Art), the
				artist, and the outdoor advertising company that presumably produced the
				design. Foster and Kleiser and General Outdoor Advertising Co. are the two
				firms most often mentioned on cards. The company <emph render="doublequote">Sales Promotional Service</emph> is also found. This
				company may have distributed stock design cards to subscribers, probably
				outdoor advertising companies, to solicit use of its artwork. The cards were
				thus used as sales tools--some are printed on the reverse with information
				directed to clients including pricing. Some General Outdoor Advertising Co.
				cards appear to have designs stamped in blue ink. This particular group of
				cards was used in recordkeeping; they contain information about particular
				clients that used the design such as client name, pricing, contract length,
				salesman, and type of display.</p>

				overlap, and so certain topics appear in more than one category. A few numbered
