         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Duke University, located in Durham, N.C., was
		  established by James B. Duke in 1924, but it evolved from
		  the following institutions in Randolph County, N.C.:
		  Brown's Schoolhouse, 1838-1839; Union Institute, 1839-1851;
		  Normal College, 1851-1859; and Trinity College, 1859-1892.
		  In 1892, Trinity College relocated from Randolph Co. to the
		  present location of Duke's East Campus in Durham, N.C.
		  Because of this complex history, the University has
		  celebrated anniversaries of two major founding events: the
		  establishment of continuous education at Brown's
		  Schoolhouse in 1838, and the creation of the Duke
		  Endowment, which transformed Trinity College into Duke
		  University in 1924. As a result, the institution
		  commemorated the 100th Anniversary of its beginnings in
		  Randolph County in 1938, the 50th Anniversary of the Duke
		  Endowment and founding of Duke University in 1974, the
		  150th Anniversary of its beginnings in Randolph County in
		  1988, and the 75th Anniversary of the Duke Endowment and
		  founding of Duke University in 1999.</p>
         <p>In 1838, Methodist and Quaker families in rural
		  Randolph County, N.C. employed Brantley York as a permanent
		  teacher for their subscription school in Brown's
		  Schoolhouse. One hundred years later, Duke University
		  commemorated the 100th Anniversary of its humble beginnings
		  during the 1938/1939 academic year. The Centennial
		  Celebration, a three-day event featuring ceremonies,
		  symposia, lectures, and performances, took place April
		  21-23, 1939. </p>
         <p>During the 1974/1975 academic year, Duke
		  University celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding.
		  On December 11, 1924, James Buchanan Duke signed an
		  Indenture of Trust creating the Duke Endowment, which
		  established Duke University. The 50th Anniversary
		  Celebration took place the weekend of April 11-13, 1975.
		  Events included a film festival, concerts, convocation,
		  reception, service of worship, and symposia. </p>
         <p> Faculty, students, alumni and friends of Duke
		  University travelled to Randolph County, North Carolina, in
		  September 1988, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of
		  Duke's beginnings as a log schoolhouse about 75 miles west
		  of Durham, N.C. Celebration events included a dedication of
		  the Archdale-Trinity Historical Society Museum, birthday
		  parties, tours, lectures, and a symposium. </p>
         <p>During the 1999/2000 academic year, Duke
		  University celebrated the 75th anniversary of James B.
		  Duke's creation of the Duke Endowment -- the fund that
		  transformed Trinity College into Duke University. The
		  annual Founder's Day celebration, observed on Sept. 30,
		  1999, commemorated the Endowment with a series of events
		  focusing on the University's ties to the Duke family. </p>

               <p>Faculty, students, alumni and friends of Duke
				University travelled to Randolph County, North Carolina, in
				September 1988, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of
				Duke's beginnings as a log schoolhouse about 75 miles west
				of Durham, N.C. The celebration in Trinity -- a rural town
				that grew up around the college before it moved to Durham
				and became Duke University -- was among the first of
				several festivities planned to observe Duke's
				sesquicentennial. At the celebration, participants walked
				to the spot where John S. Brown built his one-room
				subscription schoolhouse and placed a marker commemorating
				the site where Duke University was born. Although the
				institution's name has changed in the course of 150 years,
				university historians have settled on Duke's origins as
				1838, when the farming community around Brown's Schoolhouse
				hired Brantley York to provide continuous education for its
				children.</p>
               <p>Sesquicentennial events in Trinity, N.C.,
				included a dedication of the Archdale-Trinity Historical
				Society Museum, a program, a birthday party at the Trinity
				College Memorial Gazebo, and tours. Other celebration
				events included a Duke-Durham birthday party, a Blackburn
				Society meeting, and a seminar, lecture series, and
				symposium.</p>

            <scopecontent>
               <p>Collection includes articles, printed matter,
				correspondence, clippings, subject files, photographs,
				programs, and financial materials. Major subjects include
				Sesquicentennial Celebration planning and events, the
				historic marker for Brown's Schoolhouse, and the plaque and
				maintenance of the Trinity College Memorial Gazebo.
				Materials range in date from 1988 to 2000 (bulk 1988-1989).
				The collection also includes a program from the Centennial
				Celebration of the relocation of Trinity College to Durham,
				1992.</p>
