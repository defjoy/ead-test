            <p>The papers of Washington Duke, tobacco manufacturer and
philanthropist, were initially assembled in 1951 from the former Trinity
College Papers and the papers of his son, Benjamin Newton Duke. Over
the years additional transfers were made from the papers of his sons,
James Buchanan Duke and Benjamin Newton Duke, as well as from the
W. Duke, Sons and Company Records. Gifts to the collection came from
Mrs. James H. Semans (Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans) in 1969;
Wachovia Bank and Trust Company in 1959; and the Duke Homestead
in 1972.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The bulk of the papers of Washington Duke, a tobacco manufacturer
and philanthropist, date from 1890 to 1905, but the papers include items
as early as 1764 and as late as 1987. The collection is a created one;
materials from several sources have been brought together to form the
Washington Duke Papers. The collection relates primarily to the financial
and philanthropic interests of Washington Duke after his retirement from
W. Duke, Sons and Company in 1880. There are five series:
Correspondence, Financial Papers, Genealogical Papers, Legal Papers,
and Miscellaneous Papers.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series begins with two letters (photocopies)
written by Washington Duke in 1863, when he was preparing to enter the
Confederate Army. After the war Mr. Duke began establishing his
tobacco business. This series contains no correspondence for the period
1865-1889. The bulk of the correspondence covers the period
1890-1905, after Mr. Duke had retired from the tobacco business. These
letters reveal his financial and philanthropic interests after retirement.
Letters come from the following sources:
<list type="simple">
               <item>1. Relatives, seeking aid or sending thanks for gifts.</item>
               <item>2. Methodist Episcopal Church, South, members and ministers
seeking assistance for church buildings, furnishings, orphans, widows,
and missionaries.</item>
               <item>3. Schools and colleges asking for aid or expressing appreciation
for aid given. Louisburg Female College, Rutherford College, Trinity
College and Kittrell College were among those writing about finances.
The orphanage at Oxford was supported for a number of years. Many
students, both black and white, sought financial assistance from Mr.
Duke in the way of scholarships or loans.</item>
               <item>4. Business associates or would-be partners seeking financial
assistance or employment. These letters are largely concerned with
textiles and tobacco. For example there are letters reflecting Mr. Duke's
encouragement of black capitalism in the founding of the Coleman
Manufacturing Company at Concord, N.C.</item>
               <item>5. People who were ill or unlucky, many of them very
impoverished.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>The letters in the Correspondence Series dated 1975-1976 are
concerned with Washington Duke's dealings with the J. W. Scott and
Company in Greensboro, N.C. (1871) and the nomination of St. Joseph's
A.M.E Church in Durham to the National Register of Historic Places.
This series does not include any original letters written by Washington
Duke.</p>
         <p>The Financial Papers Series consists of records of Washington
Duke's business interests and philanthropy. The oldest volume is a ledger
(1873-1877), kept at the time Washington Duke and his sons moved
their factory from the farm to Durham. Duke tobacco products were
being shipped to markets from Maine to California, including locations in
frontier Montana. An account book for the Durham Warehouse covers
the period 1876-1884 and gives an interesting glimpse of the beginnings
of Duke tobacco organization. Records were kept of purchases of
tobacco, promotion trips to Europe and Australia (1883-1884), and the
entry of George Washington Watts into the firm (1878). </p>
         <p>A summary of the personal finances of Washington Duke is noted in
financial papers dating from 1893 until the time of his death in 1905.
These records include a journal, ledger, cashbook, and check stubs. They
are parallel in content and supplement each other; they appear to have
been the work of his private secretary, James E. Stagg.</p>
         <p>The journal (1893-1905) indicates gifts to family, relatives, and
individuals, as well as transactions with institutions such as the White
Rock Baptist Church, St. Joseph's AME Church, Louisburg Female
College, and the Durham Conservatory of Music. Businesses noted
include the American Tobacco Company, the Virginia-Carolina Chemical
Company, Cary Lumber Company, together with a number of cotton
mills, railroads, and banks. </p>
         <p>The cashbook (1893-1905) lists, in more detail, dividends from
investments as well as donations to individuals and institutions over a
period of a decade or more. Washington Duke was consistently generous
to his immediate family and his many nieces and nephews. His tithing to
the church covered gifts to the Main Street Methodist Church, ministers,
Negro churches, orphanages and schools. With the coming of Trinity
College to Durham, he made generous contributions to its finances,
including small gifts to the baseball team and to the library for book
stacks. The check stubs cover the period 1899 to 1905. The final entry
refers to the balance transferred to his sons after Washington Duke's
death.</p>
         <p>The ledger (1893-1904) contains accounts listing mills, railroads, and
other property. Also included are notations concerning rents, personal
expenses, tithes and repairs. Many names of Durham citizens appear
here.</p>
         <p>The Genealogical Papers Series contains the Washington Duke
family Bible (1861) as well as family trees and correspondence regarding
lineage and descendants of Duke family members. The bulk of the
material is photocopies from the James B. Duke Papers, including copies
of letters which detail what Washington Duke remembered about his
family. </p>
         <p>The Legal Papers Series includes copies of court, marriage, and
property records pertaining to the Duke family and its settlement in
Orange County, in the vicinity of present-day Durham, N.C. Other
papers include a copy of Washington Duke's last will and testament
(1900) and the indenture establishing the Doris Duke Trust (1925).</p>
         <p>The Miscellaneous Papers Series is composed of pictures, clippings,
and general materials. The pictures are primarily photographs of homes,
people, and tobacco factories. They have no dates and many are copies
of originals on permanent loan to the Duke Homestead, a National
Historic site. The homes include those of Taylor Duke (presumed) and
Washington Duke, as well as interior views of rooms at the Duke
Homestead. There are pictures of Washington Duke and of his statue and
of three buildings on the Duke Farm used as tobacco factories prior to
the move to Durham.</p>
         <p>Clippings are family and business related dating from 1890-1987. A
Memorial Album of notices on the death of Washington Duke (1905) is
arranged alphabetically by city.</p>
         <p>General materials relate to the Duke Homestead and include a variety
of other printed and manuscript items. Among them are a Tribute to
Bishop Marvin, ca. 1877 (photocopy); Resolution of Thanks and
Appreciation, St. Joseph's AME to Washington Duke, 1902; a
Resolution by the Board of Directors of the Fidelity Bank in memory of
Washington Duke (1905); and a manuscript list of persons sending
condolences/flowers on the death of Washington Duke, 1905. Photostats
of two records in the C.S.A. Archives in the National Archives are
concerned with the Civil War career of Washington Duke. One, dated
April 4, 1864, is a report for Co. A of the Camp Guard by Captain
George B. Baker, Assistant Quartermaster at Camp Holmes, Raleigh.
The second item is a list of men who signed up for three years service in
the Confederate Navy. Washington Duke's signature appears on both of
these documents.</p>
