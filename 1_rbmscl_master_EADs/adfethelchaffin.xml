<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Ethel Tison Chaffin was born on January 13, 1921 in Natchitoches, LA.  From childhood on, she took dance classes with a variety of instructors and, as a college student, studied dance at Louisiana State University, New York University, the University of Maryland, and Bennington College.  Instructors included John Martin (former dance critic at the New York Times), Charles Weidman (Humphrey-Weidman Technique), Ethel Butler (Martha Graham Technique), and Nina Fornoff (Hanya Holm Technique).  Ms. Chaffin also participated in master classes with Martha Graham and Katherine Manning.</p>
<p>In 1943, Ms. Chaffin married Verner Franklin Chaffin and taught dance at Louisiana State University.  She moved to Tuscaloosa, AL in 1947 following Mr. Chaffin’s appointment to the faculty of the University of Alabama’s Law School.  While in Tuscaloosa, Ms. Chaffin opened her own studio in 1948 where she primarily focused on children’s dance instruction.  Upon her husband’s recall to the armed services during the Korean War, Ms. Chaffin and their two children (Ethel Tison and Verner Franklin) moved to Japan to join her husband.  During the family’s time in Tokyo, Ms. Chaffin attended numerous Kabuki and Noh drama performances and performed, with her children, in two traditional Japanese festivals.</p>
<p>Following their time in Japan, the Chaffins returned to Tuscaloosa where Ms. Chaffin again taught dance after the birth of the couple’s third child (Mary Davis) in 1954.  In 1957, the Chaffins again moved, this time to Athens, GA, and Ms. Chaffin elected to retire from dancing after the birth of their fourth child, John Edwards, in 1960.  Despite giving up dancing itself, Ms. Chaffin remains a dedicated proponent and aficionado of modern dance.  She and Mr. Chaffin have made numerous donations to the University of Georgia in support of both the Law School and the Core Concert Dance Company.</p>

<p>The bulk of the materials in the scrapbook document Ms. Chaffin's training as a dancer.  Her earliest materials include photographs of her childhood dance classes and performances that are annotated with brief descriptions.  Materials that address her secondary education and graduate-level work include yearbook pages, photographs, postcards, programs, and clippings.  Of particular interest are her programs, reviews, and postcards that she sent home from Bennington College's School of the Dance. These materials are heavily annotated by Ms. Chaffin and give the researcher a sense of the life of a student at this famed dance institution.</p>
<p>Additional sections of the scrapbook cover Ms. Chaffin's career as a dance educator, as well as an aficionado post-retirement from active performance and teaching.  The materials that document her career as an instructor include photographs of her students' performances, as well as programs and flyers advertising her studio.  Materials that document her career post-dance include programs and reviews of performances that she attended, as well as an article profiling her as a graduate student working towards her Master's degree in the history of drama and theater during the '70s.</p>
