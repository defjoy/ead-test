         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>In 1912, the Society, located in St. Louis, Mo., held a contest calling for submissions of original compositions for piano. The response, according to a letter from the Society, was overwhelming. The Society received over 3000 submissions from all over Europe, and North and South America. One hundred four of them make up this collection.</p>

      <scopecontent>
         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of 104 original piano compositions entered into a contest held by the Society. It received over 3000 entries from all over Europe, and North and South America. These entries were apparently intended for return to the contestants, but were never mailed. The compositions were divided into three classes: Class A for concert piano solos, intended for public performance by advanced musicians; Classes B and C were written as less demanding salon pieces; Class C especially for short character pieces. Composers were supposed to identify themselves by motto rather than by name on their compositions (though some used names). The range of mottoes selected is quite diverse and interesting. </p>
         <p>Sixty-one different composers are represented in this collection, including at least five women. Most of them were from Germany, Austria, Italy, England, Romania, Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela. A few submitted photographs and biographical information with their pieces. A few letters and prize lists from the Publication Society are also included.</p>
