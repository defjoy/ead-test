      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains chiefly correspondence, dates ranging 1830-1950, to and from Nathan H. Hill concerning his work teaching freedmen in Lincolnton, N.C., as well as family correspondence and other documentation from members of the Hill, Usher, Wright, Jones, Self, Bostick, and Thornburg families and their friends and associates. Family correspondence relates to routine family matters and everyday life. Of particular interest are several letters from Albion W. Tourgée, founder of the Bennett College, a historically black college for women in Greensboro, N.C. In these letters, Tourgée discusses conditions of former plantation lands in the South and states that he will encourage people from the North to purchase these lands. Nathan Hill also received frequent correspondence from George Dixon, a Quaker from Yorkshire, England who was also involved with the freedmen's schools in North Carolina. These letters, bulk dates ranging 1865-1867, describe the Quakers' work with African-Americans after the Civil War, especially the freedmen's school in Lincolnton, N.C.</p>

<p>The papers also include legal documents, dates ranging from 1810-1927, and financial documents, dates ranging 1823-1915, as well as some undated documents. The materials consist primarily of bills receipts, letters granting power of attorney, letters of indenture, statements of debt repayment, insurance paperwork, vouchers for property rental, and other materials relating to property, debts, and other public concerns, primarily in Randolph County, N.C.</p>

<p>There are a small number of bound materials such as a grade school register, voter registries, and an undated day book. The collection also contains printed materials relating to church activities and Guilford College.
