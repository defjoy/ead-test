<head>Biographical Note</head>

<bioghist>
<p>Margaret Durham was born on April 14, 1898 in Gastonia, NC.  She attended Martha Washington College in Abingdon, VA from 1913-1916, and then transferred to Trinity College for her senior year, graduating in 1917.  One of several family members to attend Trinity, she was a member of Kappa Delta and Delta Phi Rho Alpha and served as secretary of the Virginia Club.</p>
<p>
In September 1922, she married Harry Russell Robey.  She taught French and English Literature at Martha Washington College and Southern Seminary Junior College, and succeeded her father as President of the Southern Seminary.  She received a Master's degree in Education from the University of Virginia in 1952, and served on multiple academic and non-academic committees on educational, social and women's issues.  Durham was also President of the Alumni Association.

<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>These items were originally included in a string-bound scrapbook created by Margaret Durham. The scrapbook was 50 pages long and contained items reflecting her extra-curricular life at Trinity from 1916-1917.  Items from 1917-1918 include photographs of a May Day celebration, as well as clippings regarding and correspondence with classmates from Trinity, many of whom served in the U.S. military during World War I.  The original scrapbook contained many three-dimensional objects, which had separated from the bookâ€™s pages.  Pages were removed and placed in archival folders, and loose items in envelopes, for preservation. </p>
