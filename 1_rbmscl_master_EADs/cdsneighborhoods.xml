            <abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">The Neighborhoods Project was created as
                part of the Community Programs department within Duke's Center for Documentary
                Studies. According to the CDS website, it offered North Carolina elementary school
                teachers an innovative and effective way to meet social studies goals outlined in
                the state's standard course of study. The project provided a way to engage students
                in their own communities, focusing on their individual lives and stories through
                photographs, narrative writing, and storytelling. It provided a series of
                experiential learning activities that encouraged the use of photography, oral
                history, and narrative writing in an exploration of community and
                citizenship.</abstract>

            <abstract encodinganalog="520">Collection includes black-and-white photographs,
                negatives, and slides from projects created by students at Durham's E.K. Powe and
                W.G. Pearson elementary schools between 1997 and 2004. The images document the
                social life and the built environment in Durham, N.C., in city neighborhoods where
                the students live; they feature children, pets, houses and places of business,
                groups of adults, and other neighborhood scenes where whites, African Americans, and
                Spanish-seeking citizens live. Some materials are in Spanish. Also includes some
                student booklets and publications highlighting their projects as part of the
                program. Acquired as part of the Archive for Documentary Arts.</abstract>

            <p>Adapted from a Center for Documentary Studies website:</p>

            <p>The Neighborhoods Project, created by local teachers and Center for Documentary
                Studies (CDS) staff members, offered North Carolina elementary school teachers an
                innovative and effective way to meet social studies goals outlined in the state's
                standard course of study. The project provided series of experiential learning
                activities that allowed students to engage with their own communities, focusing on
                their individual lives and stories through photographs, narrative writing, and
                storytelling, and exploring ideas of community and citizenship.</p>
            <p>The Neighborhoods Project received support from the Civic Education Consortium, the
                Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, and the North Carolina Arts Council, an agency funded
                by the State of North Carolina and the National Endowment for the Arts. It was
                disbanded in 2010.</p>
