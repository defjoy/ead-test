<p>Henry Call Sprinkle, born November 20, 1902, in Mocksville, NC, was the son of Henry Clay Sprinkle and Annie Van Eaton Call of Mocksville, NC. Margaret Louise Jordan was born on January 20, 1903. Henry attended Trinity College (now Duke University) and obtained an A.B. in 1923 and an A.M. in 1924. That same year, Henry joined the North Carolina Conference and was assigned as a junior preacher and director of religious education at First Methodist Church, located in Rocky Mount, NC. He earned a B.D. in 1927 and Ph.D. in Philosophy, 1929, both from Yale University. On February 17, 1930, Henry Sprinkle married Margaret Jordan. Dr. Sprinkle pursued post-graduate studies in 1935-36 and spent a year at Cambridge University in London, England. From 1929 to 1942, Dr. Sprinkle continued to serve a number of churches throughout North Carolina. He went on to serve as a Navy Chaplain in the US Navy during WWII, and held the rank Lt. Commander. Dr. Sprinkle also served as assistant editor of the Adult Student in Nashville (1930-1935), editor of the North Carolina Christian Advocate (1945-1949), Associate Editor of World Outlook (1949-1952), Editor of World Outlook (1952-1966).

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection includes the travel diaries and notebooks of Margaret Jordan Sprinkle and Henry Call Sprinkle, written from 1935 to 1986. This collection is arranged into two series: Margaret J. Sprinkle Diaries and Henry C. Sprinkle Diaries and Notebooks. Early diaries and notebooks contain detailed information about their travels in Europe, providing commentary on the differences between American society and various other places, particularly English society, culture, attitudes and perspectives. Margaret's entries provide significant insight relating to political climate of Europe at the time and events leading up to WWII. Starting in the 1950s, the diaries reflect the broader international travels of the Sprinkles, as a result of their involvement in missionary work. Entries usually include travel itineraries, as well as descriptions of various social, cultural, and political conditions of various cities and regions throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and Australia. The majority of diary entries detail daily activities, family life, social obligations, events in North Carolina, particularly in Durham, and events at Duke University.</p>
