<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection is chiefly made up of correspondence, containing much information on Smith's family, his career and journeys as a sea captain, and the Civil War period.  The earlier material in the collection consists of letters from Smith to his parents and to his first wife, Elizabeth, and concerns Smith's voyages on the trading vessel Eutaw, carrying coffee and cotton between Delaware and Calcutta, India; his transfer to the brig Mary in 1831, his connection with the shipping firm of Grinnell, Minturn and Company; and the wrecking of the ship Sampson in 1841.
