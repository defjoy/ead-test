<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>The Popsicle was invented by accident when, at age 11, <persname>Frank Epperson</persname> left a cup of soda water with stirring stick outdoors during freezing temperatures. In adulthood, Epperson sold his frozen invention at fairs, and initially called it the <emph render="doublequote">Epsicle.</emph> His children referred it <emph render="doublequote">Pop's sicle</emph> and the product's name was subsequently changed to <emph render="doublequote">Popsicle</emph>.</p>
<p>In 1923, Epperson applied for a patent for <emph render="doublequote">frozen ice on a stick.</emph> In 1925, he sold the rights to his invention to the <corpname>Joe Lowe Company</corpname> of New York. At this point, the Lowe Company entered into an agreement with the <corpname>Good Humor Company</corpname> not to use either milk-based recipes, or rectangular designs, in order to minimize product competition. In 1932 the Good Humor Company sued Joe Lowe and Popsicle for infringing on this agreement, noting that Popsicle products had begun to encroach upon Good Humor's products in the shapes and amount of milk used.</p>
<p>Originally, popsicles were offered in seven different flavors. The <emph render="doublequote">twin</emph> Popsicle was invented during the Great Depression, an era in which the product's sales increased. During the 1950s, as freezers became more common in suburban households, the Popsicle multipack started to be sold in supermarkets.  In 1965, Popsicle was purchased by <corpname>Consolidated Foods Corporation</corpname> and again in 1986 by the <corpname>Gold Bond Ice Cream Company</corpname> of Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1989 <corpname>Unilever</corpname> acquired <corpname>Gold Bond</corpname>, which owned both <corpname>Breyers</corpname> and <corpname>Good Humor</corpname> brands along with Popsicle; Unilever's ice cream division became known as <corpname>Gold Bond-Good Humor</corpname>. In 1993, this name changed to <corpname>Good Humor-Breyers</corpname>.
