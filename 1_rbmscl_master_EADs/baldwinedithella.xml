<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>Edith Ella Baldwin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 19, 1870 to Ellen L. T. Peckham and Charles Clinton Baldwin, the son of Reverend John Denison Baldwin. She was baptized at All Saint's Church in Worcester in November 1888. She was an artist who produced paintings and miniatures, as well as a craftswoman and bookbinder. Her entry in <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Representative Women of New England</title> says she studied at the Julian Academy in Paris and exhibited at the Salon of the Champ de Mars in 1901, and in Worcester in 1903. She died on February 21, 1940.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection and its volumes represent over 20 years of work by Edith Ella Baldwin. There is no indication that any of her writings were published, although rejection letters included in one of the volumes suggests that she did attempt to become published at one point.</p>

<p>Each volume consists of typescript or carbon copy pages, sewn into cloth boards with dyed red cloth covers stamped with gold lettering; two volumes are burlap and one is corduroy. Some of the volumes' bindings are loose or separated from their covers. The texts have been copy-edited with corrections throughout, along with several re-titled in pencil. Most volumes' title pages include notes explaining whether the work is a fragment, unfinished, or complete; how they "must not be changed"; and how many are "the only copy in existence." Several stories also include Baldwin's handwritten introduction, summarizing the action or presenting the theme.</p>

<p>Many of the stories explore love and religion, but several are noteworthy for their contemporary subjects. "The Automobile" is a short story written in 1907 following two women as they tour New England in their Pope Hartford automobile. "Antony the Foreigner," an unpublished 1912 novel, concerns anarchists, labor strikes, worker unrest, and the suspicion of foreigners. The most notable text is the 1911 "Affairs at Farslope," a 140-page novella about a women's refuge for troubled young girls and how proper sex education could have prevented their misfortune.</p>

<p>Along with Baldwin's fiction and poetry, the collection includes lecture notes from several courses she took on bookbinding, cooking, nursing, and art. There are also her efforts at preserving her family's history, including a copy of her aunt's diary, dated 1848-1854; several of her grandfather's sermons; a volume of stories and poems by her younger sister, who died at age 11; and selected excerpts of her own journal kept while studying art in Paris from 1889-1892.</p>

<p>The materials have been arranged by genre, with the Fiction and Poetry Series making up the bulk of the collection; the Non-Fiction Series consisting largely of lecture notes and diary entries; and the Family History Series, which includes her aunt's diary, other family writings, and sermons. Within each series, materials have been arranged chronologically.</p>

The story revolves around a women's refuge for troubled young girls, with talk of suffragettes, and one young girl seduced by a man afflicted with "the unmentionable disease" causing her child to be born blind. "Girls surely had a right to protection. Romance was all very well where a world was righteous and men saints, but the world was in spots as bad or worse than it had been; yes, worse perhaps, for the innocent suffered for wrong they had never committed, and the wicked escape and flourishes. ... The modern way of the nineteenth century which had dwelt upon the spirit was only a half truth. Things had been taught that flesh and spirit were at war, and everything that went with flesh was shameful and wicked. Lust, gluttony, etc. were wrong, of course.... But to teach that hunger, thirst, and other things were wicked in themselves was cowardly." An unpublished novel that sheds insight into women's views on sex at the turn of the century.</p>

They also comment on the 1889 World's Fair, seeing Sandra Bernhardt's performance as Cleopatra, and having dinner with their aunt's friend, impressionist painter Mary Cassatt. Baldwin describes one evening, "We dined with the Cassatt's last Sunday evening ... Miss Cassatt and her mother talked incessantly and very interestingly. Old pa Cassatt, beside whom I was placed at dinner, was very gallant, but distressed because he was so exceedingly deaf... I think if I had to listen to them continually I should wish to become deaf, like pa Cassatt." Her sister adds that Cassatt was "an exceedingly clever woman, although a little eccentric. Her mother is a bright little old lady of seventy six and both mother and daughter say just the same thing in just the same voice and the effect is a little unusual."</p>

	<p>Cover title: Summary. 28 pp. An organized and circumspect index of Baldwin's writing (listing the title, word counts, and year written for each) along with an introduction titled, "The Three Periods of My Literary Output," in which she defines each period, her age at the time, and the type of writing she produced. While not all of the material noted in the index is found in the Papers, a substantial portion is present. Also in this volume is a manuscript draft of the Last Will and Testament of Edith Ella Baldwin, in which she notes, "What I have written in fiction, verse, or instruction must not be destroyed. It is my earnest hope to have it found worthy of preservation for it represents the real work of my life." Laid into the volume are her baptismal certificate, several newspaper clippings, and a photograph of her dated 1911 September 26 with a note reading "E.S.B., 1910 -- age 39 years, last photograph taken."</p>
