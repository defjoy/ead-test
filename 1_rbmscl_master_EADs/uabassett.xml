		  John Spencer Bassett, a professor in the History Department

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection contains personal and professional
		  papers related to the life and work of John Spencer
		  Bassett. Materials range in date from 1802 to 1998 (bulk
		  1893-1911) and include biographical information,
		  correspondence, printed material, newspaper clippings,
		  manuscripts, and souvenirs. The correspondence (1893-1917)
		  includes a copy of a 1911 letter to Charles Frances Adams
		  in which Bassett gives his account of the Bassett Affair.
		  Other correspondents include Oswald G. Villard, William
		  Kenneth Boyd, Edwin Mims, and William E. Dodd. Much of the

		  Colony Memorial Association. Clippings ([1802]-1896)
		  include articles about North Carolina politics, Civil War
		  history, the Bassett Affair, Trinity College matters, race
		  relations, the media, and education. The manuscripts
		  include the autobiography of Jessie Lewellin Bassett, wife
		  of John Spencer Bassett, in which she describes her life
		  from 1866 until her marriage to Bassett in 1892; a copy of
		  the paper,
		<title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">How to Collect and Preserve
		  Historical Material,</title> that Bassett presented to the

		Woodward's Ph.B. thesis,
		<title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Causes and Progress of the
