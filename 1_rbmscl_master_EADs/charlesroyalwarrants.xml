<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>King Charles II of England (1630-1685) did not have any official heirs. He did, though, have many children by a number of mistresses. Historians believe the number of children is somewhere between 10 and fifteen. The use of 'armes' or titles of nobility and the privileges that came with it was one way the King acknowledged that these were his children. The most children attributed to a relationship is that between King Charles and Barbara née Villiers (1641–1709), the Duchess of Cleveland, five, all of whom are named in this collection.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>This collection contains royal warrants or decrees issued during the reign of King Charles II of England concerning the assignment of 'armes' or royal titles. Four of the seven documents are written on behalf of the King by the Earl Marshall of England. Two are 'certification of armes' by Edward Walker. The remaining item is a listing of possible heraldic figures to be used for any of the King's children. The names listed in the warrants are sons and daughters of the King and three of his known mistresses. Those listed include Anne Palmer Fitzroy, Charles Fitzroy, Charlotte Fitzroy, George Fitzroy, and Henry Fitzroy, children of Charles II and Barbara née Villiers (1641-1709). Charles Lennox, the son of Charles II and Louise Renée de Penancoet de Kérouaille (1649–1734) and Charles Beauclerk, son of Charles II and Nell Gwyn (1650-1687). Three of the four warrant papers are early drafts of the final documents.</p>
