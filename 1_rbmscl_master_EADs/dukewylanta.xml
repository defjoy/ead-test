<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Wylanta Rochelle was likely born in 1881, although her birthdate is sometimes listed as 1882 or 1883, to her parents: Durham merchant Sydney Leander Rochelle and his wife, Jeanette Rochelle. On 11 June 1910, Wylanta, then 19 years old, married the 63-year old Brodie L. Duke (1846-1919), becoming his fourth and final wife. Duke and Rochelle were married in Camden, N.J. by Justice of the Peace Frank Garrison only one day after a Presbyterian minister in Washington D.C. refused to marry the couple due to Duke's two previous divorces.</p>
<p>Duke died on 2 February 1919 at the age of 73, and Wylanta continued to manage the couple's property affairs and use his surname until she married her second husband, Isaac Richardson Strayhorn (1889-1923), an attorney from Hillsboro with an office at 205 E. Main St., likely in 1920. On 3 September 1923, Strayhorn died in Nice, France from injuries inflicted by a motor vehicle accident in which Wylanta and others were also injured in late August of that year.</p>
<p>By August 1930, Wylanta had married Connor Woodward Aycock (1893-1941), the son of former North Carolina governor (1901-1905), Charles Brantley Aycock. Connor passed away on 12 October 1941, and Wylanta married her fourth husband, 39-year old Perry Clayton Eldridge (1903-1956), a former teacher and a sales repesentative for Standard Oil, one year later, in 1942. The marriage was short-lived, and Wylanta and Eldridge divorced one year later, in 1943.</p>
<p>On 22 October 1949, Wylanta married her fifth and final husband, Thomas Michael Holt Jr. (?-1979), son of another former N.C. governor, Thomas Michael Holt. The couple lived together at 607 Watts St. Holt Jr. died in 1979, and Wylanta died the following year, in 1980 at the age of 99, using the name Wylanta Rochelle Holt on her tombstone. It is unclear how many children, if any, Wylanta had.</p> 
<p>Wylanta, through both her family and her husbands, owned a number of properties in Durham, many of them located on North Magnum Street, which she frequently rented.</p>

<p>The correspondence series contains primarily greeting and Christmas cards sent to Wylanta during her lifetime. The bulk of the correspondence is from the late 1920s. These notes are addressed to Wylanta according to her current married surname and generally express holiday greetings, well wishes, and, occasionally, thank her for gifts or sympathy sentiments received, invite her to weddings and other events, or request charitable gifts. Many of these greeting cards have no handwritten notes other than a signature. More in-depth are a handful of letters between Wylanta and her sister, Hettie (primarily from 1900-1925, Hettie Rochelle Blankenship lived 1893-1979), her future husband, Perry Elridge, and several other female friend correspondents. Topics addressed in these notes including current events such as World Wars I and II, love, business and property rental issues, Wylanta's winter home in Miami Beach, Durham society gossip, and family matters. There are also a small number of letters from merchants in response to Wylanta's requests for purchases. From 1923 there is a large amount of correspondence and condolence letters related to Wylanta's car accident in Nice, France, after which her husband, Isaac R. Strayhorn, died from injuries sustained. The correspondence series is organized chronologically.</p>

<p>The photographs series contains a number of black and white photographs. Many of these images show Wylanta at various stages of life, including portraits of her wearing several of her wedding gowns. Other photographs show individual and group portraits of Wylanta's husbands, siblings, and other family members, as well as a large number of as-yet unidentified individuals. A woman with glasses appears frequently in these images, and is likely Wylanta's sister Hettie. There are two photographs of Brodie L. Duke seated, one that perhaps shows a Duke tobacco barn, and three images showing him and Wylanta in front of a mock-up of Niagra Falls; likely created as souvernirs of their honeymoon. There is a radiograph x-ray of what seems to be Wylanta's dislocated or broken shoulder, resulting from her 1923 motor vehicle accident in France. The materials in the photographs series are organized by who or what they represent. All of the oversize photographs are contained in Box 5.</p>
