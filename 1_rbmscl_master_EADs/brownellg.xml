<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection consits primarily of letters written by Grace Donald Brownell to friends and family in New Jersey.  However, also present are scattered letters of Ezra Carly Brownell.</p>

<p>Letters of 1918 primarily describe the couple's journey from New Jersey to San Francisco and the voyage to China on the S.S. Nanking.  Present are descriptions of the cities of Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah, including a  visit to the Great Salt Lake and San Francisco, California.  Letters also describe the voyage from San Francisco to Shanghai including missionaries, Y.M.C.A workers, schoolteachers, and Red Cross workers aboard the S.S. Nanking; stops in Honalulu, Hawaii and Yokohama, Japan.  Letters also offer observations of Japanese and Chinese cultures, the laboring poor in China, the effects of embargo on the native population, and differences in local dress based on class and gender.</p>

<p>Letters of 1919 offer descriptions of life in Beijing and Tientsen, China.  Letters prior to the couples' relocation to Tientsen describe visits to a local convent, orphanage, tea house, market, and temple; preparations for and celebrations of the Chinese New Year; modes of Chinese worship and perceived "superstitions"; and activities with the local Woman's Club.  Letters from Tientsen include detailed descriptions of the couples' home and furnishings, Bastille Day celebrations in the local French settlement, the activities and services of various religious denominations including the Church of England, Union Church, Catholic Church and Christian Science, meetings with numerous diplomats and dignitaries including the American, British, and Prussian Consuls and the Chinese Commissioner of Foreign Affairs, as well as Grace's teaching position at a Methodist Mission School.</p>  

<p>Letters of 1920 and 1921 continue to focus on the couples' daily life in Tientsen including various club activities, trips into the country side, the cost of goods, services, and various commodities, and descriptions of a visit to a Womens Temple.  Many of the letters, however, discuss social and political developments in China including student demonstrations and unrest, the boycott of Japanese goods, and the beginning of factionalism within the military mentioning General Wu Peifu of the Zhili clique and accusations of other factions collaborating with the Japanese.  Letters also describe the influx of refugees into Tientsen from the provinces due to famine and factional fighting and various foreign relief efforts.</p>
