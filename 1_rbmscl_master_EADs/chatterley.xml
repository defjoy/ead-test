<p>After having their home in Spencer destroyed by a F-4 tornado, they have decided to rebuild their commercial property into a home 1/2 mile south of town. This was once the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge. Legend has it that an artist traveling through sometime in the 1950s painted the scenic mural on the wall in exchange for several days stay in the adjoining motel. I tried to talk Dave into letting the mural remain in what would become their living room. Consideration was given but the mural fell to the Twedts' hammers the following week. Over the month of July, the Twedts and I filled several dumpster loads in the gutting process of this property.</p>

SARIN (Spencer Area Recovery and Interfaith Network) was a faith-based organization headed by the Rev. Mark Dickson, pastor of the Sun Prairie Baptist Church near Salem, South Dakota. Nearly 1 million dollars was collected in donations and SARIN was responsible for distributing the funds--which they did mainly to those who were under (or not) insured. The Twedts felt this was unfair. Dave made this sign in December, 1998 and it was stolen from his property on Christmas Eve, 1998.</p>

<p>I had not seen Lloyd in nearly four years--about the time he and Nancy divorced. When this image was made, he was living in Sheldon, Iowa, an hour and a half from Sioux Falls and working in an ethanol plant. I once thought of him as my closest friend in South Dakota... Many people thought the tornado had hardly fazed Lloyd, and they were probably correct. But nobody in his family called and asked how he was in the weeks that followed the storm... This image was made the day Suzy Webb married her high school boyfriend, Mike... Lloyd had not been out to the farm in nearly three years. It was hard to know what he was thinking.</p>

<p>The home in the center of the photograph belongs to Cookie Mentle. Her son Troy once owned the car in the driveway. Troy, Richard Stone, and another boy were fishing during the day of the May 30, 1998 tornado. They were in Troy's garage cleaning fish when Troy saw the tornado coming into town. He managed to get himself, Richard and the other boy into a storm cellar just seconds before the tornado passed over them. Richard Stone credits Troy for saving his life. Troy died the following Halloween weekend from liver failure due to excessive drinking. He was living an apartment in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I spoke to him on the phone just a few days before. His name is present on the tornado memorial in town along with the six others who passed on May 30, 1998. The Stones' house is in the distance to the left. </p>
