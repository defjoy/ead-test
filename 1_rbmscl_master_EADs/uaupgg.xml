<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>The Duke University Program in Genetics and Genomics serves as the primary training environment for students at Duke University interested in graduate Genetics and Genomics and has existed for the past 25 years as a forum for those interested in genetic and genomic approaches to questions of biological interest.   The program was founded in 1967 and acts as an umbrella graduate training program that spans several basic science and clinical departments and bridges the medical center and the college of arts and sciences.</p>
