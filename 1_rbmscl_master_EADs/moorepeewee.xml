<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>"Pee Wee" (Numa Smith) Moore was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on March 5, 1928. After attending Washington High School in Raleigh and Hampton College in Virginia, Moore began performing professionally as a baritone saxophonist in the early 1950s.  He played with such artists as Lucky Millinder, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Mary Lou Williams, Bill Doggett, and Rich Hargrove. While Moore resided in New York for much of his professional career, he eventually returned to Raleigh, where he performed regularly as a saxophonist throughout the 1980s and beyond. Moore passed away due to complications from pancreatic cancer on April 13, 2009.</p>
