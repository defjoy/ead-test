<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>St. Katherine's Hospital was chartered in Queen Matilda's reign in 11, and established near the London Tower. Its primary mission was to lead divine services in its church, educate poor children, and provide living quarters and medical care for a group of poor adults. According to reports in the collection, in the 19th century it was located in Regent's Park, County of Middlesex. It had a chaplain, a master, a small group of brothers and sisters, and 20 each of bedesmen and bedeswomen, a sexton, an organist, gardeners, other supporting staff, and tenants. Hospital staff performed various charitable support for the poor and led services in its chapel. They also administered a day school, which consisted of about 36 boys and 24 girls, who "were clothed but not fed." These children came from the households near St. Katherine's.  </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The St. Katherine's Hospital records consist of account books and other financial, administrative, and legal records for the Royal Hospital of St. Katherine's of London during the last half of the 19th century, that offer many details on its properties, tenants, staff, grounds, and expenses. The draft account books itemize the rental of properties to tenants and the rent charged and received, as well as stipends paid to staff and other expenses.  Other financial and legal records include a will, various internal reports, and the earliest item, a receipt (1849) from the Sailor's Home for a certain individual's upkeep and allowance. The rent account books cover items such as rent, taxes, and construction supplies for material upkeep, among others. Also included are two reports published in 1866 and 1871 by Royal Commissions who conducted an assessment and audit of St. Katherine's Hospital, with detailed reports on the condition and extent of its tenant farms, gardens, school, and buildings, and with maps of the hospital grounds. Finally, three pieces of correspondence from the 1870s pertain to financial and legal transactions.</p>
<p>Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</p>
