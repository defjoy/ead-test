		<abstract encodinganalog="520">The Burr L. Robbins Papers span the years
		  1936-1975, and chiefly consist of three scrapbooks containing photographs,
		  clippings, periodicals, memorabilia, and promotional materials. The majority of
		  clippings are from advertising industry publications and Chicago newspapers.
		  The loose materials section also includes administrative records. The
		  collection primarily documents Robbins' career in outdoor advertising with the
		  General Outdoor Advertising Company (GOA), and his involvement with
		  professional advertising organizations, particularly the Outdoor Advertising
		  Association of America (OAAA). Professional and outdoor advertising themes in
		  the scrapbooks include Robbins' career advancement; his public speaking
		  engagements on the role of advertising agencies in America; professional
		  meetings and conferences; the history of GOA; outdoor advertising history;
		  tension between citizens' groups and outdoor advertisers over billboard zoning;
		  and legal decisions. The scrapbooks also touch on topics of personal interest
		  to Robbins, including news about the Delevan Lake Improvement Association;
		  Robbinswood Farm sheep; and family events. Photographs in the scrapbooks are
		  primarily of professional meetings or conferences, or publicity events. Loose
		  materials include items that were once part of the scrapbooks, and separate
		  items. This section includes a notebook of 1942 photographs and papers about
		  the 13th National Contest and Exhibit of Outdoor Advertising Art. Photographs
		  of the three prizewinning posters, created by John DeLooy, Andrew Loomis, and
		  Albert Staehle, are included in this notebook. Also in this section is a
		  spiral-bound GOA publication,
		  <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Image with Words,</title> that documents a
		  1963 Chevrolet electric outdoor advertising campaign.</abstract>

		  Poster Advertising Company; the Executive Committee of Outdoor Advertising
		  Incorporated (OAI); Majestic Radio and Television Corporation; Walker and
		  Company of Detroit; Old Colony Advertising Company; Mercantile National Bank of
		  Chicago; and the Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company.</p>
