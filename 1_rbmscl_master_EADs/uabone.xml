         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Allan H. Bone was born on June 10, 1917. He received a bachelor's degree in music in 1939
		  from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a master's degree in music in 1941 from the
		  University of Rochester, Eastman School of Music. Bone briefly taught in the Madison Public Schools
		  and at the Southern Illinois Normal University-Carbondale before coming to Duke University in
		  1944.</p>
         <p>At Duke, Bone served as Director of Bands from 1944 to 1950, and began as an Assistant
		  Professor of the Department of Music in 1945. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1951, and
		  to Full Professor in 1959. Bone was perhaps best known for his work as conductor of the Duke
		  Symphony Orchestra from 1947 to 1983. He also served as Chairman of the Department of Music from
		  1960 to 1966 and from 1973 to 1974.</p>
         <p>Bone held numerous summer session appointments and guest conducted at many high schools
		  and colleges. He founded the Durham Civic Choral Society, and played clarinet in a number of
		  recitals and performances. Bone retired from Duke in 1983, although he continued teaching courses
		  at Duke after that date. He died on August 18, 1992 in Durham. He was survived by his wife,
		  Dorothy, and two children, Ronald Bone and Holly Nothnagel.</p>
