         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>A largely self-taught educator, Methodist
		  minister, and author of a series of English grammars,
		  Brantley York (1805-1891) was asked by Methodist and Quaker
		  farmers in rural Randolph County, N.C. to help provide
		  education for their sons and daughters. At the site of the
		  former Brown's Schoolhouse, he organized Union Institute
		  Academy in 1838 and met with instant success, building two
		  new buildings within a year-and-a-half. Though gratified at
		  his accomplishment, he worked extremely hard raising money,
		  and he began to go blind working late at night preparing
		  recitations in subjects he had not adequately studied. In
		  fact, he recorded in his diary a statement saying he
		  considered his years at Union Institute to be "truly
		  onerous." York, however, had found his life's work at Union
		  Institute and though completely blind by age forty-eight,
		  he lived to be eighty-six and founded half-a-dozen schools,
		  lectured over 8,000 times, and taught more than 15,000
		  pupils. He served as Principal of Union Institute from 1838
		  to 1842.</p>
         <p>Duke University (Durham, N.C.) was established in
		  1924 and evolved from the following institutions: Brown's
		  Schoolhouse (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1838-1839; Union Institute
		  (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1839-1851; Normal College (Randolph
		  Co., N.C.) 1851-1859; Trinity College (Randolph Co., N.C.)
		  1859-1892 and (Durham, N.C.) 1892-1924. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Brantley York Records and Papers include
		  correspondence, clippings, a grade book, certificates,
		  manuscripts, and published works. Modern materials were
		  added to the collection; these include York family
		  genealogical information, as well as clippings about York
		  and his activities. Preservation photocopies of all
		  deteriorating clippings have been made for patron use. </p>
         <p>The first series, Brantley York papers, includes
		  certificates and other documents, a small amount of
		  correspondence, and a grade book. The second series,
		  Writings, features manuscript drafts and a published copy
		  of York's autobiography, as well as copies of three of his
		  instructional texts. The final series contains both
		  contemporary and modern clippings about Brantley York's
		  life, work, and family members. Also included in this
		  series is a York family genealogy. </p>
