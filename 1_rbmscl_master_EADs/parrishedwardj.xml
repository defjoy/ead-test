<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Edward J. Parrish (1846-1920) and Rosa Bryan Parrish (1852-1927) were residents of Durham, N.C., and traveled to Japan and China in connection with Parrish's work as a representative for American Tobacco and the British-American Tobacco Company.  During his successful operations in Japan establishing a tobacco market, Parrish had conferred upon him by the Emperor of Japan the "Third Order of Honor," and was decorated with the "Medal of Sacred Treasure."  Parrish was born in Pound Hill, in what was then Orange County, N.C., in 1846.  He attended Trinity College, and served for a short time in Company "K," 4th N.C. Cavalry, in the last year of the Civil War.  He married Rosa Bryan in 1870 and moved to Durham around 1871 to establish a grocery and confectionery store.  He then became a tobacco auctioneer, and built the first brick tobacco warehouse in Durham in 1879 (later destroyed by fire).  The Parrish family's primary home in Durham before moving to Japan in 1898 was a large Second Empire structure on Main and Dillard; upon his early retirement around 1904, he remodeled "Lochmoor," on North Roxboro Road (both residences were later demolished).</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The papers of Edward Parrish primarily consist of business and personal correspondence (chiefly 1900-1921) of Parrish and of his wife, Rosa Bryan Parrish. Parrish was connected to the American Tobacco Company. The early papers, including turn-of-the-century photo albums, relate to the Murai family and to Murai Brothers, a Tokyo cigarette manufacturing company of which Parrish was the first vice-president.  Two of the photographs albums were owned by Kichibei Murai, and contain photographs of his residences and of banks, mines, oil fields, farms and tobacco factories in which he had an interest.  Also included are photographs of travels in China. </p>

<p>Other papers include personal letters from Parrish written during his stay at Hot Springs, Arkansas; bills for purchases made by Rosa (Bryan) Parrish; letters from Jones Fuller, her attorney, concerning the collection of Parrish's insurance policies after his death; letter books containing Parrish's letters from Durham, N.C. and Tokyo, 1900-1905; a notebook on tobacco trade with China and Japan, 1894-1900; a Bible owned by Parrish; and a scrapbook and postcard album created by Rosa Parrish.
