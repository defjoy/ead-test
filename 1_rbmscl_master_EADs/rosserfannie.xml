      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Fannie B. Rosser, a native of Lynchburg, Virginia,
		  was the daughter of Edmond and Callie Rosser and sister of
		  Maggie, Pansy, Joseph Irvin and James Boyd Rosser. Edmond
		  Rosser was a porter for the Pullman Palace Car Company and
		  the Rosser family apparently occupied a position of status
		  and influence in the African American community of
		  Lynchburg.</p>
      <p>Rosser moved to Durham, North Carolina after being
		  offered a position by the North Carolina Mutual Life
		  Insurance Company in September of 1914. For thirty-two
		  years she was employed by the Mutual, owned rental
		  properties in both Durham and Lynchburg, and lived in
		  Durham for the remainder of her life.</p>
      <p>Although she never married, Rosser was a foster
		  mother to Mattie Douglas Burton, and a guardian aunt to her
		  brother's daughter, June Rosser. Burton married Dr. Earl
		  Randolph Meyers of Fresno, California in 1946. They had
		  five children, and Mattie Meyers became a leader in the
		  Fresno chapter of the NAACP where she served as president
		  for some time. June Rosser married Eugene Hudson Penick in
		  1961. She had a least three children and remained
		  consistently financially dependent on her aunt until
		  Rosser's death.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Fannie B. Rosser, [1860s]-1973,
		  document the personal and professional life of a black
		  business woman within a fiscally sound African American
		  community. Correspondence, legal and financial papers, and
		  photographs reflect both her business activities and her
		  relationships with close friends and family members from
		  the turn of the century to the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the correspondence until the 1950s
		  pertains to Rosser's business ventures in regard to the
		  maintenance of her property, personal loans made to family
		  and friends, and her investments in government stocks and
		  bonds. Letters from her lifelong friend and business
		  partner, Virginia Randolf of Lynchburg, Va., document the
		  process of maintaining Rosser's rental property over the
		  course of thirty years. They highlight, among other things,
		  the apparent ghettoization of the neighborhood in which her
		  houses were situated, and Randolf's personal and financial
		  response to that process.</p>
      <p>Friends and family members often deferred
		  financial matters to Rosser, a careful and respected
		  business woman, and were often dependent on her for
		  monetary support. The correspondence illustrates Rosser's
		  financial acumen and demonstrates the extent to which her
		  personal relationships and business activities overlapped.
		  Of particular interest is an exchange with the Wilhoite's,
		  a couple to whom she loaned $1000, during the Depression.
		  Their correspondence illustrates the personal nature of her
		  business dealings and the difficulties Rosser had in
		  balancing finances and friendships.</p>
      <p>Later correspondence centers around Rosser's
		  relationships with her daughter Mattie and niece June.
		  There are scattered references to the political climate of
		  the 1960s, and correspondence from Mattie mentions her work
		  with the NAACP. However, the letters perhaps are more
		  valuable in providing a window to the relationships between
		  these women.</p>
      <p>The series of photographs in the collection date
		  back to the early 1860s and are mostly individual portraits
		  and group photographs of the family members and friends. An
		  unidentified ambrotype of an African American woman dated
		  prior to the Civil War indicates that the family might have
		  been free.</p>
