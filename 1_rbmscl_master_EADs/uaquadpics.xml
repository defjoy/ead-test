<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>Quadrangle Pictures, also informally known as Q.P, Quad Pics, and Quad Flix, formed in 1928 to screen films on campus. It quickly became the central source of campus entertainment. Sponsored through the YMCA, it made annual reports to the University Motion Pictures Committee. Walter M. Upchurch, '31, who as a student originally began the film screenings, managed the program from 1931 to 1941.</p>

<p>The program encompassed much more than just films. In its early days, films would be accompanied by newsreels, cartoons, organ concerts, and community sings. On special occasions such as the annual birthday parties, entertainers such as Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman brought their musicians and singers to play. Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra even did a live CBS radio broadcast during the tenth birthday event.</p>

<p>In 1933, Upchurch, now also serving as Director of Student Activities, opened "A School of Movie Palace Operation," a non-credit course that allowed students to earn some money while learning the concepts of theater operation. At its height, Quadrangle Pictures had forty uniformed ushers, who marched, drilled, and memorized daily schedules. The "School" closed in 1941.</p>

<p>Page Auditorium was equipped with an organ used to lead organlogues and community sings. The program also sponsored a record lending library that provided to students a large selection of classical recordings. After World War II, there were significant changes in Quadrangle Pictures. Film screenings moved to the weekends, ushers lost their uniforms, and live performances ended. More of the entertainment programming on campus was organized by the Duke University Union, created in 1954.</p>

<p>Quadrangle Pictures became a staff-administered program of the Union, advised by the Duke Film Society, an independent group founded to encourage film appreciation. Screenings of films moved to the Griffith Theater in 1988. In 1991, administration of Quadrangle Pictures passed to Freewater Films, which shows popular films on weekends under the Quad Flix name.
