         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>John Wesley Alspaugh was born July 22, 1831 in Winston-Salem, N.C.  He earned a degree from Trinity College (Randolph County, N.C.) in 1855.  Alspaugh studied law and began practice in Winston-Salem, where he also became editor of the Democratic paper, the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Western Sentinel</title>. In 1858, he was appointed chief clerk of the State Senate, and in 1877, helped establish the First National Bank of Winston.  Interested in civic progress, Alspaugh served as the first mayor of Winston-Salem, and was a principal supporter of Trinity College.  He became chairman of Trinity's Board of Trustees, and a member of the Committee of Management, which ran the school from 1884 to 1887.  Alspaugh remained as chairman of the Board for twenty years.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The John W. Alspaugh Papers contain letters from J. S. Carr and J. A. Gray concerning the uncertain financial state of Trinity College (Randolph County, N.C.). Also included are claims, letters of recommendation, a student petition regarding food vendors, and reports of the Committee of Management.</p>
         <p>The letters of the other two members of the Committee of Management, Julian S. Carr and James A. Gray, concern the finances of Trinity during the critical struggle for the institution's survival, when many pledges to an endowment fund were unpaid. Notes signed by the Committee of Management had to be met, speakers approved, scholarships considered, teachers employed, insurance paid, meetings arranged, and reports prepared, among other business.</p>
         <p>In 1886, the question of employing Dr. John B. Bobbitt as collection agent for Trinity was debated.  The quest for funds was hampered by the impossibility of collecting a loan to Charles L. Heitman. Meanwhile, the executor of the estate of Braxton Craven was pressing for settlement of debts owed by the college.</p>
         <p>With the arrival of President John Franklin Crowell in 1887, the Alspaugh correspondence diminishes, although he remained as chairman of the Board of Trustees for many years. Still haunting the Trustees was the debt against Mrs. Craven for the college bells.  John B. Bobbitt was trying to secure payment for his services as a collector of notes pledged to Trinity.
In 1889, S. L. Leary of Charlotte, N.C. offered his services as an architect for the new buildings needed when the college considered moving to Raleigh, N.C. </p>
         <p>Two broadsides, dated 1884 and 1886, contain reports of the Committee of Management of Trinity College.  Also included is the annual report made by Chairman of the Faculty William H. Pegram to the President and Board of Trustees of Trinity College.</p>
