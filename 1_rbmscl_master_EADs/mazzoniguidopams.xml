<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">The pamphlet collection was assembled over many decades by Guido Mazzoni, Italian Senator, Dante scholar, professor, and rare book collector.</abstract>

<abstract encodinganalog="520">The Guido Mazzoni Pamphlet Collection spans the years 1572 through 1946, with  approximately 49,648 pieces in the collection. The bulk of the material, chiefly in the Italian language, dates from the mid-eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries. Formats represented include: pamphlets, libretti, clippings, newspapers, scores, manuscript items, small cards, periodicals, small volumes, broadsides (some very large), epithalamia (pieces produced on the occasion of a wedding), and one photo album. There are many illustrated publications, fine engravings, woodcuts, and items with maps enclosed. About 80 percent of the material is in the Italian language, though other languages are represented, most notably Latin, French, English, German. There are also publications in Greek, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, and Eastern European languages. A fully searchable <extref href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingdb/mazzoni/">online database</extref> offers access to brief descriptive records for each item.</abstract>

<abstract encodinganalog="520">The largest and most developed subject areas, with thousands of pamphlets in each series, are Italian history from the inception of population on the Italian peninsula through the 1940s, with emphasis on the 18th and 19th centuries; Italian language and literature from its earliest manifestations through the 1930s; Italian and European politics, ranging from the Etruscan body politic to political developments in the 1930s; and biographical works on Italian notables.</abstract>

<abstract encodinganalog="520">Smaller but still very important subject collections include Italian education, social life and customs in Italy, archaeology, music, art history, and religious history. The literary, political and scientific individuals represented by the collection are too numerous to mention in this introduction, but more detailed information can be found under the section for each subject area. As Guido Mazzoni was the proteg&#233; of Giosu&#233; Carducci, that poet is most well-represented; also, as Mazzoni was one of the leading Dante scholars in Italy of his time, materials on Dante Alighieri and his works number in the thousands.</abstract>

<scopecontent><head>Collection Overview</head>

 <p>The Guido Mazzoni Pamphlet Collection spans the years 1572 through 1946, with  approximately 49,648 pieces in the collection. The bulk of the material, chiefly in the Italian language, dates from the mid-eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries. Formats represented include: pamphlets, libretti, clippings, newspapers, scores, manuscript items, small cards, periodicals, small volumes, broadsides (some very large), epithalamia (pieces produced on the occasion of a wedding), and one photo album. There are many illustrated publications, fine engravings, woodcuts, and items with maps enclosed. About 80 percent of the materials is in the Italian language, though other languages are represented, most notably Latin, French, English, German, Greek, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, and Eastern European languages. A fully searchable <extref href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingdb/mazzoni/">online database</extref> offers access to brief descriptive records for each item. Hundreds of pamphlets, particularly the epithalamia, were described more fully for the library's online catalog and can be found by using the subject keywords "provenance" and "mazzoni guido." A full set of more than 30 volumes held by the library offers photocopied images of Mazzoni's handwritten catalog slips for subject and name access to the pamphlets. Additional access in the form of digitized images of cover pages and some content, is found at the 1994 exhibit web site, <extref href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/mazzoni/exhibit/">A Renaissance at Duke: the Guido Mazzoni Pamphlet Collection</extref>.</p>

		  <p>Guido Mazzoni built up his library in several ways. He purchased many items from rare book dealers and other book sellers in Italy, particularly in Padua, Florence, and Bologna. His colleagues and former students sent him thousands of offprints, extracts, and small volumes of their work, most of them inscribed to Mazzoni. He accumulated materials from his work in the Italian Senate, most notably in areas of education, politics, and the humanities. He also acquired either by purchase or by inheritance entire libraries of academic colleagues, some of whom became his relatives by marriage. Some of these names include Giuseppe Chiarini, his father-in-law, and Raffaello Fornaciari.</p>

<p>The importance of the Mazzoni Pamphlet Collection primarily lies in its contribution to the fields of European and Italian studies. It is a broad but selective bibliography - put into material form, as it were - of nineteenth-century European culture and its transition into the twentieth century.  The intellectual arrangement assigned to the pamphlets by library staff places them into thirty-one subject areas, described in detail at these links:</p>

</p>

<p>The largest and most developed subject areas, each represented by thousands of pamphlets, are: Italian history from the inception of population on the Italian peninsula through the 1940s, with emphasis on the 18th and 19th centuries; Italian language and literature from their earliest manifestations through the 1930s; Italian and European politics, ranging from the Etruscan period to the 1930s; and biographical works on Italian notables.  Smaller but still very important subject collections include Italian education, social life and customs in Italy, archaeology, music, art history, and religious history. Many individual items, particularly literary publications, are rare and difficult to locate in the United States and even in Italy.</p>

<p>The literary, political and scientific individuals represented by the collection are too numerous to mention in this introduction, but more detailed information can be found under the section for each subject area.  Suffice it to say that virtually every important poet, dramatist, writer, historian, and political figure of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is represented, and, perhaps more importantly, many minor authors and political figures of those eras whose works are now difficult to find.  In addition, prominent scientific individuals of the nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries are represented in the collection.  As Guido Mazzoni was the proteg&#233; of Giosu&#233; Carducci, that poet is most well-represented; also, as Mazzoni was one of the leading Dante scholars in Italy of his time, materials relating to every topic in Dante studies number in the thousands.</p>

<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>

<p>Pamphlets and other items were marked on front cover with Mazzoni's original accession numbers; these call numbers and the original order have been retained. </p>

<p>Mazzoni's call numbers consist of a capital letter (A-G), an Arabic numeral, and a Roman numeral, and so are distinguishable from all other Rubenstein Library call number formats. For example, A.13.XV represents pamphlet number 15 in group A, section 13. Some large-format items have been given a "Q" or an "F" to designate them as oversize materials. They have been separated from the main collection and housed in appropriately sized containers, and appear at the end of this finding aid. </p>

<p>The pamphlets are housed in section order, A-G, in pamphlet boxes; the contents for each box can be found in the online catalog records for each letter section.  For abbreviated bibliographic descriptions for each individual piece, see the keyword-searchable <extref href="http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/mazzoni/">online database</extref>. These item-level records give the call number, title, year of publication, author, one subject category, and other notes.</p>

<p>The Guido Mazzoni library acquisition consisted of Mazzoni's library of books as well as the pamphlet collection.  The rare volumes and other publications, including many of the "per nozze," in Mazzoni's main library were cataloged for the Perkins Library Rare Book Department, and many titles were also cataloged for the Perkins Library general book collections.  All of these items can be found in the online Duke Libraries catalog by searching for the note linking them to the Guido Mazzoni library.
