         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Trinity Park School operated from 1898 to 1922 to better prepare young people for
		  undergraduate work at Trinity College and other institutions. In a prospectus prepared prior to the
		  opening of the school on September 7, 1898, it explains, "Very many young men apply for entrance to
		  Trinity and are found upon examination unprepared and hence are not admitted. The idea of providing
		  for this class of students at the college and under the immediate direction of the college,
		  originated at the Western North Carolina Conference [of the Methodist Church]." According to the
		  1898-99 Trinity Park High School catalog, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of
		  Trinity College supported this proposal, and agreed to oversee the new school in June of 1898. In
		  only three months, the school had several new buildings for its use and it opened its doors.</p>
         <p>The Trinity Park High School, as it was then known, was located on the northwest corner of
		  the present-day East Campus of Duke University, where the Mary Duke Biddle Music Building and the
		  Branson Building now stand. Trinity College President John Carlisle Kilgo oversaw the new
		  headmaster, J. F. Bivins, but the school operated semi-independently. From the start, the school
		  had high aims, and in the 1898 catalog, the hazards of ill-prepared students were spelled out: "The
		  period of a boy's life between the ages of twelve and eighteen is the most important one in his
		  educational career. In most cases his habits of study and his character itself are fixed at the age
		  of eighteen. If he has had slack preparation and loose discipline, he becomes disheartened, and
		  abandons all hope of entering college and properly fitting himself for life."</p>
         <p>The school had a junior class, one or two intermediate classes, and a senior class. Among
		  their required subjects were arithmetic, geography, Latin, English, Greek, algebra, history, and
		  physics. Because the school was located so close to Trinity College, the students were allowed to
		  use the college library and attend lecture courses, as well as have use of the gymnasium. Wh n the
		  school opened in 1898, 71 students were enrolled, including 11 girls. Two students came from
		  Virginia, one from Tennessee, and the rest arrived from points across North Carolina, although most
		  came from the Durham area. According to Earl W. Porter's
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Trinity and Duke, 1892-1924: Foundations of Duke
		  University</title>, the school quickly became a success, and increased its enrollment and became
		financially stable within a few years. New buildings had also been added to the campus, providing
		more dormitory space. Trinity Park School (the name was changed from Trinity Park High School to
		differentiate it from public schools) was a source of pride--and students--for Trinity College.
		According to Porter, "As late as 1907 only eight secondary schools in the Carolinas even offered as
		much as fourteen units of work"--the minimum required to be considered for admission to Trinity
		College.</p>
         <p>Two major courses of study were offered: the classical and the Latin-scientific. Both
		  courses were quite similar, with classical students required to take several languages and
		  Latin-Scientific required to focus on natural and physical sciences. Students were expected to
		  attend school from approximately 9am to 2 pm, and to study from 7pm to 10pm. Afternoons were
		  reserved for physical activity.</p>
         <p>Students were expected to periodically make declamations pertaining to their courses of
		  study. Two organizations, the Grady Literary Society and the Calhoun Literary Society, offered
		  their members the opportunity to practice their declamation and debate skills. An annual
		  competition between these two societies occured each year at commencement, when the top speaker was
		  awarded a medal. Other extra-curricular groups included the Young Men's Christian Association, the
		  Athletic Association, and the Park School Gazette. Mandatory chapel services were held daily.
		  Although Trinity College had a Methodist affiliation, students could select the church of their
		  choice in Durham to attend on Sundays. </p>
         <p>Students were expected to behave properly at all times, although "Foolish and unnecessary
		  rules are avoided; only as such are necessary to the safety, peace, and well-being of the whole
		  community are adopted," according to the 1904-1905 Trinity Park School catalog. Most students
		  conducted themselves with decorum, but those who "are addicted to loafing or disorderly behavior at
		  night and who are careless in their study are required to attend the 'Night School' and study under
		  a master's [teacher's] direction." In rare cases, when warnings and Night School did not achieve
		  their desired effect, a student would be asked to leave Trinity Park School permanently.</p>
         <p>Over time, the public school system improved in North Carolina. As these schools improved,
		  fewer students attended Trinity Park School. In summer 1922, the Board of Trustees decided to close
		  the School, and use the buildings and space for the growing undergraduate class. Trinity Park
		  School was remembered fondly, however. As Porter writes, "It had held the line for Trinity until
		  the public schools could arrive."</p>
         <p>Although the school no longer exists, several buildings still stand as part of the East
		  Campus of Duke University. The Branson Building was constructed in 1899 with funds from Benjamin N.
		  Duke. Its original use was a dormitory for Trinity College, and in 1915 it was remodeled for use as
		  a dormitory by Trinity Park School students. After the School closed, it again became a College
		  dorm. In 1935, the building was torn down, but some of its materials were used to create a new
		  Branson Building, used as an engineering laboratory. In 1950, the building was again remodeled,
		  this time becoming the present-day Branson Theater.</p>
         <p>Bivins Hall, built in 1905 and named after the first headmaster, J.F. Bivins, was used as
		  a dormitory for Trinity Park School students. In succeeding years, it has been used as a college
		  dormitory, then the headquarters of the Departments of Botany, Zoology, and Civil Engineering.
		  Today the Bivins Building houses several arts departments.</p>
         <p>The main academic building used at Trinity Park School, the Asbury Building, was torn down
		  in 1974. It stood on the site where the Biddle Music Building stands today. The other buildings
		  that comprised the School were also torn down: Lanier Hall, a dormitory, was taken down in 1937;
		  the York Dining Hall in 1928; and the Harnett and Drummond buildings, both dormitories, were
		  destroyed by fire in 1928 and 1932, respectively.</p>
