<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Alex Harris was born in 1949 and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.  He is married to Margaret Sartor, also a documentary photographer and educator. Harris has spent the majority of his adult life in North Carolina.  His photography deals with a wide range of subject matter, documenting in particular aspects of the American South, New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska, as well as the people and regions of Cuba. Many of his works are part of major collections, including those of The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, The High Museum of Art in Atlanta, The North Carolina Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Harris has also received a variety of awards for his photography, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in Photography, a Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowship, and a Lyndhurst Prize.  He is a co-founder of the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, where he has taught documentary photography and writing since 1975.  He has also published many books on documentary photography, many of which feature his own work.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The Alex Harris Photographs and Papers span the years 1970-2012, from the time Harris was producing his earliest photographic work as a graduate student at Yale University, to his more recent work documenting the American South. The 413 black and white and color photographic prints in the collection are organized into the following series established by the photographer, and are described more fully in the collection guide: <emph render="bold">Alaska; American South; Cuba Auto/Landscapes; Game Boy; May Day: Yale on Strike; New Mexico/Arizona; Philadelphia Experience Corps; Portraits of Aging</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Mobile, Alabama</emph>. The images depict landscapes across the United States, the culture and society of Cuba and U.S. cities, and portraits and other shots of individuals spanning all ages, races, and origins. Among the images of Yale students on strike, there are photos of the radical activist Bobby Seale.  The prints range from black-and-white gelatin silver to color archival pigmented prints printed on laser or inkjet printers; sizes range from 8x10 inch reference prints to very large 24x30 inch exhibit prints, for which smaller surrogates exist; some prints are matted.</p>

<p>Four other series composed mainly of non-photographic materials document other aspects of Harris's career, especially his collaborations with other photographers and writers, and his career at Duke University, both as a teacher and as co-founder of the Center for Documentary Studies (CDS) and its magazine, <title render="italic">DoubleTake</title>.  The <emph render="bold">Publicity and Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> contains recordings of lectures as well as publicity for exhibits and publications.  The extensive <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes not only Harris's letters but also grant applications, research notes, drafts and proofs, printed materials, and photographs. The <emph render="bold">DoubleTake Files</emph> consist mainly of materials generated during the planning stages and early years of the magazine's existence; while materials on Harris's extensive collaborations on other publications, documentary projects, and related exhibitions make up the large <emph render="bold">Project Files Series</emph>, which also includes many oral histories and interviews related to his projects. The last group in the collection, the <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph>, comprises syllabi, student writings, and other materials from classes taught by Harris mainly through the CDS at Duke University.</p>
<p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

The images feature scenes and portraits of North Carolinians from counties in the eastern, central and western regions. These photographs are from very early in Harris's professional career. Additionally, the series contains 38 24x30 inch color prints (boxes 4-5) of the American South, photographed from 1984-1985.

The series captures the artist's son in a variety of settings, both public and private, playing his Game Boy and means to explore the implications of how pre-adolescent interaction with electronics might bear out on post-adolescent human interaction and relationships.

Interviews were conducted mainly by Alex Harris and Margaret Sartor.  The tapes are mainly undated, but transcripts place them between October 1985 and July 1986.  Also includes presentations by Alex Harris and Bruce Payne and others.</p>

<p>There are fifteen microcassettes and six audiocassettes in this group, arranged in order by last name, then by date. Unidentified tapes are at the end.  Includes a set of four cassettes from a Cordoned Heart symposium, 1986.  "MC" denotes microcassettes, "C," audiocassettes.  Since the transcripts contain little or no reference to the tape numbering scheme, an individual transcript cannot be assumed to contain all appearances of an individual on various tapes.  Transcripts are housed in the Correspondence Series under "South Africa--Transcripts."</p>
