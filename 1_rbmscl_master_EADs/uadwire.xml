<head>Biographical Note</head>

<bioghist>
<p>Henry Rudolph Dwire was born in Winston-Salem, NC on October 8, 1882 to Henry Xenophon and Mary Hanes Dwire.  He graduated from Trinity College with the A.B. degree in 1902 and with the M.A. degree in 1903.  During his senior year, he was editor of The Archive.  In 1904, Dwire became editor of the Twin City Sentinel, published out of Winston-Salem, and became known as one of the State's best-known editorial writers.  During his lifetime, Dwire served on the Winston-Salem School Board and was a trustee for the North Carolina State Hospital for the Insane. He founded the Winston-Salem Fine Arts Foundation and in 1931 was director of the North Carolina Art Society.  Dwire held State appointments under four successive North Carolina Governors and was a member of the State School Commission.  He was managing editor of The South Atlantic Quarterly and editor of The Duke Alumni Register.  He was director of the Duke University Press, University Vice President (1941) and Director of Public Relations and Alumni Affairs (at the time of his death) and served on numerous University committees.  He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Phi Beta Kappa.  Davidson College awarded Dwire an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree in 1943.  He died in July 1944.</p>

Most of the photographs were taken at Davidson College.  Most of the loose material was removed from a scrapbook after being transferred to the Archives in 1960.  There is adhesive on many of the pages. The collection ranges in date from 1897-1944.</p>
