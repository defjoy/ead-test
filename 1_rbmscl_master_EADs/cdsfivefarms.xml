<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The twenty-five photographic prints in the Five Farms: Stories From American Farm Families collection form part of an oral history and photography project carried out under the auspices of the Center for Documentary Studies in 2008. Beginning in March 2008, photographers Alix Lowrey Blair, Andrew Lewis, Tom Rankin, Elena Rue, and Steve Schapiro, along with oral historians, each visited an American farm to document the farm families' experiences and stories over the course of a year.  The prints in this collection reflect the photographers' work.  The locations for the Five Farms series include: a dairy farm in western Massachusetts, a diversified farm in central Iowa, a hog farm in eastern North Carolina, an organic farm in California's Capay Valley, and a family farm on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona.  The images portray farmers and family members, farm workers, farm animals, and landscapes.</p>
<p>The 25 13x16" color prints, five for each photographer, are listed in groups by the geographical locations.  The photographer's name and the caption are handwritten on the back of each print.</p>
<p>In addition to the photographs, there are also oral histories that are held by the Center for Documentary Studies.  The Five Farms project culminated in an exhibit from April 27-August 21, 2009 at Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies; other outreach included a multimedia website and programs on public radio stations nationwide.</p>
<p>Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

<p>Photographs by Andrew Lewis. The Pecusa family is Hopi and Pima from the village of Bacavi on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona.  Their immediate family has been farming in the area for at least four generations.  Before them, ancestral people farmed their land intermittently for nearly a thousand years.  The Pecusa family farms in a largely traditional manner, using little farm machinery and employing ancient dry land farming practices that allow them to grow corn in an arid environment that receives only eight to twelve inches of rain per year.</p>
<p>When not farming, Davis Pecusa also serves on the Hopi Tribal Council. The Hopi Tribe recognized Davis recently as "Farmer of the Year."  His son, David, has studied under him for as long as he can remember and recently has begun to study western organic and permaculture farming practices.  He also has a strong interest in the growing and preservation of heirloom native seeds from the Southwest.  David will soon be leaving his job as kitchen manager at Hotevilla Bacavi Day School so that he can pursue his farming interest full-time.  His dream is to teach and introduce younger generations to farming and sustainable living practices.</p>

<p>Photographs by Alix Lowrey Blair.  Jeff and Annie Main own Good Humus Produce, which they run with their three children, Zachary, Alison, and Claire, and a small crew of employees.  The Mains started their twenty-acre, certified organic farm in 1976, shortly after their graduation from the University of California at Davis.  On their farm, located in the rural hills of Hungry Hollow, near Capay, California (about an hour northwest of Sacramento), they grow about sixty different fruits and vegetables, as well as herbs and flowers.  They deliver to farmers' markets, to area subscribers through a program known as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), and to wholesalers in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Photographs by Elena Rue. Craig and LaVon Griffieon operate a diversified, 1,100-acre farm with beef, chickens, turkeys, pigs, sheep, and horses in Ankeny, Iowa, north of Des Moines.  Their farm has been in the Griffieon family since 1868.  Craig and Lavon raise corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa. Their Limousin beef herd comes from stock that has been on their farm since 1960.  Their children-Autumn, Nick, Phillip, and Julia-are the sixth Griffieon generation to farm there.  The Griffieon children are active in all phases of the farm, and have themselves raised pastured poultry for ten years.</p>

<p>Photographs by Steve Schapiro.  The Hager Brothers Farm is set on more than 700 acres of rugged, hilly terrain in Colrain, Massachusetts. Chip and Sherry Hager run the farm, along with daughter Kim and son-in-law Aaron, and another son, Todd.  Both Kim and Aaron - college graduates with degrees in agriculture - bring to their passion for farming a new understanding of the science of dairy herd management.  The family continually merges traditional and innovative approaches to dairy farming.</p>

<p>Photographs by Tom Rankin.  Eddie and Dorothy Wise raise hogs on 106 acres near Whitakers, in east-central North Carolina.  Eddie is a fourth-generation hog farmer but the first to own a farm; his father and grandfather were sharecroppers.  During a career in the military, and as an ROTC instructor at Howard and Georgetown Universities, Eddie raised hogs in his spare time. It was his dream to return home to North Carolina and farm full-time.  When he retired from the Army in 1991 at the age of forty-eight, that's what he set out to do. Dorothy Wise grew up in Washington, D.C., but she too hoped to one day live on a farm.  When she and Eddie met at Howard University in the 1980s and she discovered he was a farmer, it seemed that her wish had come true.</p></scopecontent>
