      <abstract encodinganalog="520">The Kindred Avin Ritchie Papers span the years 1939 to 1977,
        with the bulk of the collection dated between 1943 and 1945. The papers are primarily
        comprised of correspondence, particularly between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie and his wife,
        Sara Meda Henderson (S.M.) Ritchie, while he was serving in the U.S. Army Postal Service
        during World War II in various locations in the United States and Europe, primarily in
        France and England. Smaller amounts of materials also were sent from Belgium, the
        Netherlands, and Germany. Exchanges between K.A. and S.M. Ritchie include candid comments
        about marriage and sexuality, and references to Army censorship and the scarcity of goods on
        both sides of the Atlantic. Correspondence from S.M. Ritchie and other family and friends,
        including K.A. Ritchie's mother Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie, give a sense of some of the ways
        in which the war affected those at home. Photographs, programs and playbills, Nazi
        memorabilia, and other ephemera are included with much of the correspondence. </abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Kindred Avin Ritchie Papers span the years 1939 to 1977, with the bulk of the
        collection dating between 1943 and 1945, and are organized into the <emph render="bold"
          >Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Ephemera</emph>, <emph render="bold">Legal,
          Medical, and Financial Papers</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Photographic
          Materials</emph> Series. The papers are primarily comprised of correspondence,
        particularly between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie and his wife, Sara Meda Henderson (S.M.)
        Ritchie while he was serving the U.S. Army in various locations in the United States and
        Europe. Playbills and programs, photographs, Nazi memorabilia, and other ephemera are
        included with much of the correspondence. Additional materials sent to K.A. Ritchie by his
        mother Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie and other family and friends make up the rest of the
        correspondence. Small amounts of financial, legal, and medical papers, photographic
        material, and miscellaneous ephemera complete the collection. The volume and frequency of
        correspondence between Kindred Ritchie and Sara Ritchie provide an unusually full portrait
        of the perspectives and concerns of a married couple separated during wartime.
        Correspondence from K.A. Ritchie chronicles his leisure activities as well as his encounters
        with local non-military personnel primarily in England and France, but also in the
        Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Due to military censorship, K.A. Ritchie's letters do not
        include many direct details about the fighting in Europe. Exchanges between K.A. and S.M.
        Ritchie include candid comments about marriage and sexuality, and references to Army
        censorship and the scarcity of goods on both sides of the Atlantic. Correspondence from S.M.
        Ritchie and other family and friends give a sense of some of the ways in which the war
        affected those at home.</p>

          <p>Arranged in four subgroupings: correspondence between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie and
            Sara Meda (S.M.) Ritchie; from Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie to K.A. Ritchie; from family
            and friends to K.A. Ritchie; and from family and friends to S.M. Ritchie. With the
            exception of a few letters between K.A. and S.M. Ritchie from 1939-1941 before his
            enlistment, this series spans the term of K.A. Ritchie's involvement in the 20th Postal
            Regulating Section of the US Army, beginning with training at Camp Lee in Virginia
            through his journey home from Germany after the cessation of hostilities in late 1945.
            At the time of his discharge in 1945 he had attained the rank of Sergeant. In the first
            subseries, K.A. Ritchie writes to his wife from posts in Newport News, VA; West Chester,
            PA; Cheltenham, United Kingdom; undisclosed locations in France and the Netherlands;
            Gutersloh, Germany; and Antwerp, Belgium. His letters cover day-to-day operations and
            recreational activities as well as oblique or vague references to conditions in the
            European Theater of Operations. Sexuality, homesickness, boredom, and censorship are
            common themes in Ritchie's correspondence with his wife. S.M. Ritchie's letters to her
            husband chronicle her day-to-day activities in Washington DC and include details on her
            friendships with her coworkers at the <emph render="italic">Infantry Journal</emph>. The
            interval between letters from Europe and the desire to be reunited with her husband
            frequently appear in her letters, as do discussions of civilian rationing and family
            news. Letters from K.A. Ritchie's mother, Mittie Hahn Ritchie, comprise a second
            subseries. These letters detail family news from Mt. Pleasant, NC and frequently include
            clippings from the local <emph render="italic">Concord Tribune</emph> newspaper.
            Correspondence from family and friends in subseries to K.A. and S.M. Ritchie detail
            relevant news from the senders, most of whom are mutual friends in the Washington DC
            area or family from North Carolina. All correspondence is arranged chronologically by
            date.</p>
