<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>The Highlands Institute for American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HIARPT) was established in Highlands, North Carolina, as a result of the expansion of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American Journal of Theology and Philosophy</title>. Its original mission was to sponsor two conference series: one on Philosophical Theology (which began in 1988) and one on American Religious and Philosophical Thought (which began in 1990). These conferences run on a five-year schedule in Highlands.</p>

<p>The organization also developed an annual seminar series, beginning in 1990, that gradually expanded in scope and attendance. One result was the establishment of the Women's Dialogue, which began in 1992 as a means to discuss theology and philosophy from a feminist perspective. <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Writing Our Lives,</title> the first Women's Dialogue Seminar was held in June 1993. Today, the Women's Dialogue hosts annual seminars and monthly discussion groups on feminist theology.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection is separated into two series: the Women's Dialogue series and the Patricia Boyd Papers series. Despite this division, both series include corresponding files and materials from the activities of the Women's Dialogue.</p>
<p>The majority of the collection consists of program information and planning from the Dialogue's annual seminars. The earliest material dates from the 1996 seminar, but the seminars from the year 2001 and later all have more information and details. Common materials include the seminar's agenda, some information about its speaker, and other registration or logistical information. Other aspects of the collection include some historical financial records, mailing lists and rosters, and program files or speaker information.</p>
<p>One file is full of autobiographies of some of the Women's Dialogue founders, written in 1993. Another interesting component is the survey conducted by the Women's Dialogue during its tenth anniversary in 2001-2002, which resulted in the publishing of the History of the Women's Dialogue.
