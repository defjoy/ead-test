         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Faculty Club of Duke University is a non-stock
		  corporation chartered by the State of North Carolina in
		  1933. Its origins date to the formation of the Faculty Club
		  of Trinity College in 1918. History professor William K.
		  Boyd served as this organization's first president. The
		  club had fifteen charter members. The four core officers
		  (president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer)
		  constituted a Board of Governors. The Board was in charge
		  of elections, committees, bylaws, and finances. Club
		  membership included active, associate, and honorary faculty
		  (persons of distinction who had performed services for the
		  U.S., North Carolina, or Trinity College). All faculty and
		  officers of administration and instruction were eligible to
		  join the club. </p>
         <p>The purpose of the club was to foster good
		  fellowship among members; to contribute to their social
		  life; and to promote discussion of scholarly matters as
		  well as matters of general interest. In 1932 the Faculty
		  Club proposed a plan for a university medical guild, which
		  generated interest resulting in the creation of the present
		  medical and hospital care plan for the faculty and staff.
		  During the 1940s a member described the Faculty Club as the
		  "sole medium through which the entire faculty meets in a
		  social way." The organization focused on both leisure and
		  intellectual concerns. Members enjoyed annual picnics,
		  Christmas parties, smokers, athletic events, and other
		  activities. They also organized and attended lectures about
		  both national and international issues, and sponsored joint
		  meetings with the Faculty Club of The University of North
		  Carolina at Chapel Hill. Two major concerns of the club
		  were improving faculty-student relations and securing a
		  permanent home. The members had been meeting in various
		  locations on campus and in the University House, the former
		  B. N. Duke Estate in Durham known as "Four Acres." The
		  Nello Teer, Jr. House on Roxboro Road in Durham became the
		  site of the club in 1968. This proved unsatisfactory
		  because of the distance from campus, and plans were soon
		  underway to build a new facility. The Faculty Club,
		  completed around 1971, is located in Duke Forest near the
		  University golf course.</p>
