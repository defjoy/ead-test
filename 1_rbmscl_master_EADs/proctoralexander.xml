<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>The Proctors were a free African American family from the South, who left Virginia in the early 1840s, lived in Warren County, Ohio, moved to Canada in 1860, and emigrated to Haiti in 1861.  Alexander Proctor (1814-1865), a Baptist minister, died there, and his family, headed by wife Margaret Chaven Proctor (1814-?), returned to the U.S. and settled in Kalamazoo, Michigan with one of her sons.  <!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>One-folder collection of 19th century legal papers and correspondence concerning the migratory movements, legal status, life situations, and relationships of members of a free African American family.  The correspondence dates principally from the 1870s, is chiefly written by A.W. Proctor, one of Alexander Proctor's sons, and S.S. Hutchins, friend of Proctor's son, Isaac, and relates to family affairs, business, and other matters.  S.S. Hutchins is identified in the <emph render="italic">Gould's St. Louis Directory (1874), 449,</emph> as Chief Clerk in the U.S. Army Engineer's Office.  One letter from a friend to a family member mentions seeing Frederick Douglass at Wilberforce College in 1893.</p>

<p>The legal records document the free status of the Proctors, various labor agreements, and migration papers, and include receipts and letters of introduction.  Official documents from Haiti are written in French and include an 1865 order permitting the burial of Proctor at St. Marc, Haiti.  In terms of the context relating to the family's emigration to Haiti, many people that emigrated by way of the Redpath Agency to Haiti, as was the case for the Proctors, either died or were untraceable by 1864, and few managed to return to the U.S.</p>
