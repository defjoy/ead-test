            <p>The two daughters whose materials are predominant in this collection, Isabel and Mary
                Augusta, were born to Rufus Adams Coleman and Clara Elma Fleury Coleman. It appears
                from a business card that Mr. Coleman was an attorney and conveyancer in Toronto. He
                disappeared from their lives and does not seem to be referred to much in the
                collection, not even in his wife's obituary. Mrs. Coleman's parents, the Fleurys,
                were from Aurora, Ontario. Mrs. Coleman and her daughters Isabel, Mary, and Helen
                lived for a time in Toronto, then Germany. Isabel and Mary studied music extensively
                in Leipzig; Mrs. Coleman was an accomplished pianist and her daughter Mary a
                violinist. The family then moved to Berlin, then to Switzerland, after which they
                moved to England during World War I. They also seem to have lived in France and
                Italy. Mrs. Coleman and Mary Augusta lived in Europe for over 25 years. Isabel
                returned to the U.S. to work as a governess and was living in Asheville when her
                mother and sisters moved there in 1923. Mary and Isabel both taught in Asheville and
                were very active in upper-class social circles to which they belonged. The other
                sister Helen appears to have remained in Canada and may have been in the Weston
                Sanatorium, from a reference in a letter written by Isabel.</p>

            <head>Collection Overview</head>

            <p>Collection consists largely of a two-volume diary, 1895-1919, of Isabel Coleman, a
                twenty-three volume set of diaries, 1904-1971, belonging to Mary Augusta Coleman,
                and photographs of Fleury-Coleman family members and some of their residences. There
                are also two volumes pertaining to Mary Coleman's personal accounts, "French Broad
                River Garden Club, 1967-1969," a few items of correspondence and genealogy, and a
                number of clippings and printed materials. Topics covered by the materials include
                music clubs, instruction and performance (violin and piano) in Europe and the U.S.,
                women's society life and fashions in Asheville, N.C., and women's travel in European
                countries during the 20th century. There are few comments about current events, even
                during the World Wars and the Depression, but there are extensive accounts of social
                life and customs in Europe and Asheville, N.C.</p>
