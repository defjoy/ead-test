		<head>Collection Overview</head> 
		<p>The papers of the lawyer and educator William Righter Fisher and the
		  journalist Mary Wager Fisher consist primarily of correspondence, but also
		  include photographs (several of them tintypes and cartes-de-visite), financial
		  papers, diaries, clippings, printed material, and writings and speeches. Among
		  correspondents are many journalists, physicians, educators, and other notable
		  figures of the late nineteenth century including Lucy Abbott, Mercy Baker,
		  Jennie Chapin, Mary L. Booth, W.S. Burke, James Gowdy Clark, M.E. Dodge, Weston
		  Flint, P. Girard, S. D. Harris, Albert Leffingwell, Henry C. Olney, W.
		  Trickett, George Boyer Vashon, and Frank J. Webb. The collection also includes
		  letters from James B. Hazelton of the First Regiment, New York Artillery.
		  Hazelton's letters describe battles and political events of the Civil War,
		  including Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft riots. The papers
		  are particularly rich in documentation of women in medicine and women's medical
		  education in the second half of the nineteenth century; the Freedmen's schools
		  in the Reconstruction South; the movement for women's rights; and friendship
		  among American women in the late Victorian era.</p> 
		<p>The Correspondence Series includes letters from three prominent women
		  physicians of the period (Jennie Chapin, Mercy N. Baker, and Lucy M. Abbott) to
		  Mary Wager before her marriage to Fisher. In their letters they described their
		  medical education, their obstetrical experience, and the high cost of tuition
		  and living expenses at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia. Letters
		  prior to her marriage in 1876 also attest to Wager's numerous romantic
		  involvements. Among her admirers was lawyer and educator Weston Flint, and the
		  Correspondence Series includes over 100 letters from him describing his
		  political, social, and literary interests as well as his deep affection for
		  Mary Wager. He also wrote about his wartime travels and his interest in helping
		  the contrabands medically and educationally. Flint detailed political events of
		  the Civil War, including Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft
		  riots, and mentions the Copperheads. He expressed particular interest in the
		  moral state of soldiers, decrying their drinking of alcohol and consorting with
		  prostitutes. Flint sometimes included poetry in his letters.</p> 
		<p>Also in the Correspondence Series are two letters (1870) from Frank J.
		  Webb, the author of The Garies and Their Friends (1857), a daring novel about
		  an interracial couple. In one of these letters dated May 5, he referred to a
		  500-page manuscript sent to Harper's for an unpublished novel, Paul Sumner,
		  which he considered to be superior to The Garies. In a four-page letter to
		  Wager (April 9, 1870), African American writer, attorney, and educator George
		  Boyer Vashon provided an autobiography. The events of his life were penned on
		  the letterhead of The New Era: A National Journal, Edited by Colored Men.</p> 
		<p>The collection offers insight into emotionally intense friendships
		  between women of the nineteenth century. Wager's female friends sent good
		  wishes, but expressed great jealousy at the time of her marriage to Fisher.
		  Young women wrote of both romantic and sisterly love for Mary, and sometimes
		  discussed such issues as women's education, women's dress, women's suffrage,
		  and temperance.</p> 
		<p>The bulk of William Righter Fisher's letters in the collection were
		  written between him and his parents. A small cache of letters from author and
		  dean of Dickenson College Law School William Trickett, who lived in Germany in
		  1872, provide a vivid illustration of the political climate and structure of
		  the Germany of Bismarck. Also to be found among letters to Fisher are several
		  written in the late 1860's by agents of the Freedmen's Bureau and the
		  Freedmen's school in Wytheville, Virginia. </p> 
		<p>While the bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, some
		  speeches and writings by Mary Wager Fisher and Weston Flint are included. Of
		  particular interest is a photocopy of Mary Wager's article entitled 
		<title render="doublequote" linktype="simple"> Women as Physicians.</title> Also, the
		Pictures Series includes both cartes-de-visite and tintypes.</p> 
		<p>The William Righter and Mary Wager Fisher Papers provide numerous
		  windows through which researchers can view aspects of late Victorian America.
		  The collection provides an unusual entree into the private and public lives of
		  nineteenth-century men and women, and particularly provides information about
		  the professionalization of American women, relationships between women in
		  nineteenth-century America, and race relations in the Reconstruction South.</p>
