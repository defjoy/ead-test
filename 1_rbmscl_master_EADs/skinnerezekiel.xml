<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Ezekiel Skinner (1777-1855) was a missionary and physician who studied medicine under Benjamin Rush in Philadelphia. During the time period covered by this collection, Skinner was in Monrovia, Liberia working for the American Colonization Society. His first trip to Africa in 1834 was inspired by the death of his son Benjamin Rush Skinner, who was serving as a minister in Monrovia when he succumbed to illness in 1831. Although almost 60 years old, Skinner believed it was his duty to continue the work of his son. During his second trip he was appointed as an agent of the United States government to oversee settlement of new Liberian citizens arriving from the United States. He returned to the United States in 1837.</p>
