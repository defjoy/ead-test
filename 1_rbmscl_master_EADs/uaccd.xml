<head>Biographical Note</head>

<bioghist>
<p>Originally from Baltimore, MD, Curtis Carroll Davis received his A.B. from Yale University in 1938 and his M.A. from Columbia University in 1939.  He enrolled in Duke's graduate English program in 1939 and wrote a dissertation on the Virginia novelist, William Alexander Caruthers.  He received his Ph.D. in 1947.  Davis led an active social life while at Duke, attending numerous concerts and dances, and also served as president of the English Graduate Club.  Additionally, he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1942-1946.</p>
<p>
Following his graduation from Duke, Carroll worked as desk chief for the CIA, was a member of the directorate of the Star Spangled Banner Flag Home Association, and was also a prolific writer.  His most famous works include the biographies, <title render="italic" linktype="simple">King's Chevalier: A Biography of Lewis Littlepage</title> and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">That Ambitious Mr. Legare: The Life of James M. Legare of South Carolina</title>.

<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>Davis originally included these items in a 28-page scrapbook, which was unbound for preservation.  Pages are extremely brittle, and many items taped into the book had come loose, due to the decayed state of the tape.  As a result, the scrapbook pages were placed in folders and loose items in envelopes, for preservation.  Additionally, since the pages had been slightly bent to fit into its original box, the book was moved into a larger box.  Most of the photographs were taped to the pages. While the tape is disbanding from the pages, it remains on the photographs.</p>
