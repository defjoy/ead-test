<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>New York Radical Feminists was a radical feminist group co-founded primarily by Shulamith Firestone and Anne Koedt with the October 3, 1969 Stanton-Anthony Brigade, after they and other brigade members left Redstockings. Central to NYRF's philosophy was the idea that men consciously maintained power and a climate of supremacy over women in order to strengthen their egos. New York Radical Feminists members organized small 10-12 women consciousness-raising groups throughout NYC that all came together for a monthly mass business and consciousness-raising meeting.</p>
