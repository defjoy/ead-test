         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a national
		  organization, was founded in 1954 by Don McClanen. The
		  Fellowship of Christian Athletes challenges coaches and
		  athletes at the professional, college, high school, junior
		  high, and youth levels to use the medium of athletics to
		  learn leadership and moral values of the Christian faith.
		  In 1956, coaches and 256 athletes attended the first
		  national sports camp at Estes Park, Colorado. By 1964,
		  summer programs were also established at Lake Geneva,
		  Wisconsin and Black Mountain, North Carolina. By 1989,
		  there were 40,000 official members. Close to 14,000 people
		  attended summer camps in 1995. Campus programs called
		  Huddles were established in 1966 to provide a peer-group
		  meeting structure for camp attendees during the school
		  year. The number of campuses with Huddle fellowships grew
		  to around 6,600 by 1997. The organization is headquartered
		  in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
         <p> The Duke University chapter of Fellowship of
		  Christian Athletes was installed in 1960. Like other
		  chapters, the Duke University chapter emphasizes leadership
		  and fellowship among athletes and their communities. The
		  Duke University chapter included baseball, basketball,
		  football, and track players and coaches, but football
		  players were the chapter's most well-represented group
		  during the early 1960s. Informal chapter meetings were held
		  weekly and monthly. Weekly meetings were for students only,
		  while monthly meetings included a guest speaker during
		  dinner. Members of the Duke chapter attended summer
		  conferences, presented programs to churches, schools, and
		  clubs, and assisted other colleges with forming chapters.
		  </p>
         <p> Religious groups at Duke University, alumni, and
		  people in the community supported the chapter financially.
		  Annual sermons were held in the Duke University Chapel to
		  raise awareness of the chapter's activities. During the
		  spring, the Athletics Department sponsored a Blue-White
		  Spring Football Scrimmage to help the chapter raise funds
		  for conference tuition. The Fellowship of Christian
		  Athletes program at Duke University was managed in
		  cooperation with the Durham County High Schools, which
		  provided means for recruiting new athletes to play at Duke
		  University. </p>
         <p> As of 2003, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes
		  is active at Duke University. </p>
