<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>The Duke Law Dames was a social and service organization whose objective was to promote fellowship and to assist members in obtaining all benefits from the Duke-Durham area. Membership was open to law student wives, women law students, and wives of the law school faculty and alumni, although, the composition consisted mainly of law student wives. The organization presented an opportunity for wives to talk over their "common interests, enjoy interesting and educational programming, and most importantly to have fun."  The group sponsored lectures, cooking demonstrations, fashion shows, holiday parties, and other assorted social and educational events.  Structurally the Law Dames consisted of a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer.  In addition, there were chairs of programming, social events, publicity, and special projects.  Officers were elected on an annual basis.</p>
