<abstract encodinganalog="520">The Charles Roberts Anderson Papers span the dates 1806-1993 and document his active career as professor of American literature at Duke University and Johns Hopkins University.  Included are research materials on the intellectual life of Charleston, S.C., and on American literary figures such as Paul Hamilton Hayne, Emily Dickinson, Henry James, Sidney Lanier (to whom Anderson was related), Herman Melville, Henry David Thoreau, and others.  Additional material includes correspondence and files on Anderson's publications; lectures and files related to teaching; travel diaries and keepsakes; and other papers related to his family history and academic career.  Copies of correspondence and other documents by Anderson's research subjects, particularly Hayne, detail elements of life in the South in the nineteenth century. In addition, material in this collection chronicles the academic life of Anderson and provides insight into the state of literary scholarship and publishing in the mid-twentieth century. Early dates usually reflect the dates of the content of original material photocopied by Anderson in the course of his research. Acquired as part of the Jay B.

<p>Contains items from other series requiring separate housing. Early dates refer to photocopied archival material. Chiefly consists of books of research files on Paul Hamilton Hayne, which include additional copies of Hayne correspondence, as well as records of Anderson's correspondence with libraries and archive repositories as part of his Hayne bibliography project. Also included are film reels featuring the cities of Charleston, S.C. and Stratford, England in the 1930s, possibly amateur movies taken by Anderson; a reel of microfilm belonging to Mary Anderson; audiotapes of lectures on Dickinson by Charles Anderson; and a book of clippings of reviews of his book on Dickinson. Finally, photostats of Lanier research and illustrations related to Anderson's Melville work round out this group of oversize materials.</p>
