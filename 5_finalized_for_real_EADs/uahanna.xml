            <p>This collection contains the work of the Wisconsin Income Tax Commission and its studies between 1929 and 1936.  A master tabulating procedures manual is included.  Two daybooks from South Carolina, 1850-1855, contain accounts of a store which kept special accounts for African-Americans.  The volumes on the genealogy of the Hanna family are to be kept with the papers at the request of Professor Hanna.  A set of galley proofs for Institutional Economics by John R. Commons has corrections by Professor Hanna. The collection ranges in date from 1850-1936.</p>
