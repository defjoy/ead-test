         <abstract>African American civic leader during the
                period following the Brown decision of 1954 and the Civil Rights Movement. Harris
                was the first African American city councilman in Durham, N.C., and the first black
                man to sit on the Durham County Board of Education. The Rencher Nicholas Harris Papers span the years from
                1851 to 1980, with the bulk dating from 1926 to 1965. The collection consists mainly
                of clippings, correspondence, legal papers, photographs, printed materials, journals
                and diaries, scrapbooks, oversize maps, and reports relating to Harris' work in
                political and educational affairs in Durham, North Carolina in the 1950s and early
                1960s as a member of the City Council and the School Board, with emphasis on school
                desegregation, civil rights, and race relations in Durham. Also represented is
                Harris' business career in banking, insurance, and real estate, his role as an
                official of the Bankers' Fire Insurance Company, and his civic activities, including
                leadership roles in the NAACP, Lincoln Hospital, and North Carolina Mutual
                Insurance, and Mechanics and Farmers Bank, all serving African Americans in Durham.
                Some biographical materials, family papers, and correspondence also relate to his
                wife, Plassie Williams Harris. Part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for
                African and African American History and Culture at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Rencher Nicholas Harris Papers span the years from 1851 to 1980, with the bulk
                dating from 1926 to 1965. The collection consists mainly of clippings,
                correspondence, legal papers, photographs, printed materials, journals and diaries,
                scrapbooks, and reports relating to Harris' work in political and educational
                affairs in Durham, North Carolina in the 1950s and early 1960s as a member of the
                City Council and the School Board, with emphasis on school desegregation, civil
                rights, and race relations in Durham. Also represented is Harris' business career in
                banking, insurance, and real estate, his role as an official of the Bankers' Fire
                Insurance Company, and his civic activities, including leadership roles in the
                NAACP, Lincoln Hospital, and North Carolina Mutual Insurance, all in Durham. Some
                biographical materials and correspondence also relate to his wife, Plassie Williams
                Harris. In detailing the business and government official activities of Durham's
                first African American city councilman, the first black man to sit on the Durham
                County Board of Education, and an active, if rather moderate, African American civic
                leader during the period following the Brown decision of 1954 and the Civil Rights
                Movement, this collection is especially significant for the documentation it offers
                on the problems of city government and race relations in the mid-twentieth-century
                South. Includes a large group of oversize maps of Durham, N.C. Part of the John Hope
                Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture at
                Duke University.</p>

         <p>The Harward and Howard collections focus on Durham N.C. race relations, school
                segregation and integration, and Durham city politicas and government from the
                1960s-1980s. The Lincoln Hospital and N.C. Mutual collections are included here due
                to R.N. Harris' involvement with both entities, as well as the material located
                within the Harris collection relating to the two former collections.</p>

               <p>Comprised of letters, telegrams, and other types of correspondence, in the
                        form of personal exchanges between Harris and his wife and family; letters
                        dealing with his campaign and election to the Durham city Council in 1953;
                        and correspondence touching on his business activities. Of particular note
                        are letters written to Harris from Carla Myerson (later Eugster) during her
                        stay in England in 1951, which are filled with observations and impressions
                        about England and its contrasts to America, especially on race relations.
                        Starting in the mid-1950s, letters Harris received from Durham citizens give
                        evidence of the effects of the Brown decision; some letters, for example,
                        call his attention to segregation in airports and ballparks. The issue of
                        public school desegregation comes to the fore beginning about 1959.
                        Dispersed among the correspondence are clippings, financial or business
                        documents, photographs, and publications, often attached to the
                        correspondence with which they are associated. The series is arranged in
                        chronological order.</p>

               <p>Comprised of materials concerning Harris' term on the Durham City Council and
                        his service on various committees. The material takes the form of clippings,
                        correspondence, personal notes, and committee documents, including financial
                        papers, maps, meeting agendas and minutes, newsletters and pamphlets, policy
                        statements, proposals, and reports. Materials in three boxes concern Harris'
                        service on the Durham Board of Education, ranging from audit reports of
                        cafeteria systems and book funds to denials to requests for school
                        integration. In addition, there are several subseries that touch on the
                        activities of the Committee on Human Relations, Lincoln Hospital, and the
                        Durham NAACP (for which Harris served as president). The NAACP subseries
                        include an undated "Manual for Workers in NAACP Membership Campaigns," and
                        correspondence and clippings pertaining to the NAACP and its projects. The
                        subseries are arranged in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise noted, each

               <p>Comprised of bound volumes of personal and business documents relating to
                        Harris. The series is divided into three subseries arranged alphabetically:
                        Appraisals, Memoranda Books, and Scrapbooks and Volumes. The <emph render="bold">Appraisals</emph> group contains bound groupings of real
                        estate appraisals done by Harris mainly in the Durham area from 1939 to
                        1964. The appraisal reports include many photographs of commercial and
                        residential properties. The <emph render="bold">Memoranda</emph> subseries
                        includes small volumes from 1945-1963, most of which contain little
                        information. The 1955 volume, however, contains the text of several of
                        Harris' speeches and a few newspaper clippings concerning his views on
                        desegregation. The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks and Albums</emph>
                        subseries consists of a letterbook covering the years 1957-1962, dealing
                        mainly with a testimonial dinner for Harris in 1957 and with his resignation
                        from the School Board in 1962; a scrapbook containing clippings about Durham
                        civic leaders and some snapshots from 1958; a folder of letters and
                        expressions of sympathy to Mrs. Harris on the occasion of Harris' death in
                        1965; and the Harris family album that has in it family letters and
                        documents as far back as 1851, quantities of clippings pertaining to Harris'
                        political career, and many photographs. </p>
