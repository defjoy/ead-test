         <abstract>The
		  Order of the White Duchy was a secret women's honorary at
		  Duke University. The group was formed in May 1925 by the
		  Order of the Red Friars, a secret men's honorary, to
		  recognize members of the Woman's College of Duke
		  University. The members of the Order of the White Duchy
		  voluntarily disbanded the organization in 1968. Records
		  include constitution, initiation ritual, minutes,
		  correspondence, photographs, membership and alumnae lists,
		  financial records, clippings, issues of the Lucky Number
		  alumnae newsletter, and two scrapbooks. Major subjects
		  within the collection are collaboration between student
		  leaders and college administration and student opinions
		  concerning sororities, social standards, and the honor
		  code. Prominent members include Mary Duke Biddle Trent
		  Semans, Margaret Taylor Smith, Elizabeth Hanford Dole,
		  Dorothy Newsom Rankin, and Dorothy Battle Rankin.

			 placed in acid-free folders. Scrapbooks were interleaved
			 with bond or glassine paper to prevent more acid transfer

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>The Order of the White Duchy was founded in May of
		  1925 by the secret senior men's honorary the Order of the
		  Red Friars. They chose seven women whom they felt were the
		  most outstanding members of the class of 1925 to organize a
		  similar organization, although it was not to be a sister
		  organization. From 1925 on, new members were chosen, or
		  "tapped" into the order, by the seven members of the White
		  Duchy from the previous year. New members were chosen based
		  on their character, qualities of leadership, and
		  outstanding service to the university. The tapping ceremony
		  was held first at the last meeting of the Student
		  Government Association of the Woman's College, and later
		  during the final Class Night of the school year. Although
		  the student body knew of its existence and who its members
		  were, the activities and projects of the order were secret.
		  The only public notice given to the organization by its
		  members was the wearing of a white carnation on one day of
		  each month. Officers consisted of Grand Duchess
		  (President), Petit Duchess (Vice President), Custodian of
		  the Records (Secretary) and Custodian of the Funds
		  (Treasurer). Its members voluntarily disbanded the order in
		  1968 because it was felt to be too elitist and no longer
		  representative of the leaders of the Woman's College or the
		  university.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         
         
         <p>These records were created by the Order of the
		  White Duchy in the course of 43 years of activities as a
		  secret women's honorary at Duke University. Material is
		  present for the years 1925 to 1968, although it is most
		  copious in the 1950s and early 1960s, and consists chiefly
		  of minutes and scrapbooks. There are no minutes for the
		  years 1960-1961, 1961-1962, or 1964-1968. Records of any
		  sort for the years 1964-1968 are limited to "Lucky Number"
		  alumnae newsletters, some correspondence, and a study
		  abroad pamphlet in the reference series. Physical types of
		  materials include the constitution, minutes,
		  correspondence, photographs, membership and alumnae lists,
		  a cloth-bound volume of financial records, alumnae
		  newsletters, clippings, reports, pamphlets, and two large
		  scrapbooks. The scrapbook materials consist of photographs,
		  correspondence, clippings, and one artifact, a fabric crown
		  belonging to Mary (Eskridge) King, class of 1925 and
		  founding member.</p>
         
         
         <p>The history and activities of the order were kept
		  secret from the student body and much of the faculty and
		  administration. A history, copy of the constitution, and
		  the initiation ritual are preserved in the order's records.
		  The minutes detail the operations and projects of the
		  Duchy, and also contain information on student life and
		  opinion. Financial records show the expenditures of the
		  order for the given years. Correspondence relates mainly to
		  Homecoming Breakfasts, although there is some important
		  information related to integration, and to alumnae
		  post-graduation activities and life. White Duchy
		  Organization records include the "Lucky Number" alumnae
		  newsletter and existed mainly to keep members informed of
		  campus activities of current members and of alumnae doings.
		  Project folders relate to undertakings of the order that
		  may or may not be mentioned in the minutes. Reference
		  folders contain materials not produced by White Duchy, but
		  which its members either found interesting or useful in
		  their other activities, or which they felt White Duchy
		  should be acquainted with. The scrapbooks contain
		  information about members' activities during the year they
		  were active, and also updates about work and family life
		  after graduation. The scrapbooks are divided by school
		  year, each member having a page for donated items, letters,
		  and photographs.</p>
         
         
         <p>White Duchy worked within student activities and
		  government to influence policies and bring about campus
		  improvements. They seem to have been fairly important to
		  Deans Alice Baldwin and Florence Brinkley of the Woman's
		  College as a means of discovering and influencing student
		  opinion. White Duchy met and communicated over the years
		  with many university administrative officials such as
		  Herbert Herring, Alan Manchester, Mary Ellen Huckabee, Mary
		  Grace Wilson, Anne Garrard, Robert Flowers, William Allen
		  Tyree, Douglas Knight, Hollis Edens, and Paul Gross. One of
		  the research strengths of this collection is the evidence
		  of interaction and in some cases collaboration between the
		  leaders of the university and the leaders of the student
		  body, and the opinions of both that can be found on issues
		  such as integration and desegregation, sororities, social
		  standards (student life regulations), overseas programs,
		  and the honor code, among others. For material related to
		  integration and desegregation see particularly Minutes
		  1962-1963, and Correspondence related to the "Lucky Number"
		  of March 15, 1963. Duchy members were very involved in
		  campus elections, and in some cases appear to have decided
		  amongst themselves which girls should be appointed to
		  certain positions or should run for a particular office.
		  There is little evidence that the White Duchy and the Red
		  Friars worked in concert on many issues, and interaction
		  between these two groups seems mainly limited to social
		  functions.</p>
         
         
         <p>Members of White Duchy were student leaders and
		  held leadership positions in the Young Women's Christian
		  Association (YWCA), Judicial Board, dormitories, Women's
		  Student Government Association (WSGA), class offices,
		  Social Standards Committee, the Chronicle, and so on,
		  during their senior year. Members had been involved in
		  student government and activities since their arrival on
		  campus in such organizations as Freshman Advisory Council
		  (FAC), Sandals and other honoraries, sororities,
		  publications, and Hoof'n'Horn. Members of particular note
		  are Mary (Biddle) Semans, class of 1939; Margaret (Taylor)
		  Smith, class of 1947; and Elizabeth (Hanford) Dole, class
		  of 1958. Dorothy (Newsom) Rankin of the class of 1933 was
		  the first member to have a daughter honored by membership
		  in the order: Dorothy Battle Rankin, class of 1959.</p>
         
         
         <p>Achievements of White Duchy are the establishment
		  of the senior women's honorary Phi Kappa Delta in
		  1944-1945; helping to establish a campus and university
		  honor code; organization of a White Duchy alumnae group and
		  newsletter; campus improvements such as paths, benches,
		  restroom improvements, trashcans; improvement of East-West
		  Campus relations; working for integration and desegregation
		  particularly in 1962-1963; and influencing major student
		  and to some extent university policies such as the cut
		  system, drinking rules, sorority evaluations, "Who's Who",
		  and Mortar Board honor society. The White Duchy was a very
		  social organization and held many dinners, parties, and
		  cabin weekends away both for themselves and for alumnae.
		  The seven members of each year held an alumnae breakfast on
		  every Homecoming Weekend, and stayed in touch with the
		  majority of alumnae. The seven members of a given year
		  tended to be close friends, and referred to each other as
		  "ducks" or "ducklings" and to their secret campus office as
		  "the pond." Evidence of daily student life and opinion is
		  present throughout the minutes particularly, and is another
		  area important for research.</p>
         
         
         <p>White Duchy was voluntarily disbanded in 1968
		  because its then members objected to the secrecy and
		  elitism of the organization. They felt it was no longer
		  representative of campus leaders and was doing more harm
		  than good due to its selective nature. The order has never
		  been reestablished at Duke University. See article from the
		  Chronicle of May 3, 1968 in History, 1925-1968, and also
		  various discussions of the role of the order and problems
		  of secrecy in the minutes of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
