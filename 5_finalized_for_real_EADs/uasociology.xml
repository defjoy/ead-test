         <p>The Dept. of Sociology at Duke was established in 1930 by Charles Abram Ellwood (1873-1946) and remains an active department to this day offering degrees to both undergraduates and graduate students. This department seeks to educate students on the scientific study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. At Duke the department was known as the Dept. of Sociology and Anthropology until 1972 when the two fields split into separate departments. </p>
