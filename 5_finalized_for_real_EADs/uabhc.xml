            <p>Blanche Henry Clark was the daughter of Reverend J. L. Clark, who was the president of Kentucky Wesleyan College and a Methodist minister.  She grew up in Fort Thomas, Kentucky and graduated from Somerset High School before enrolling at Trinity College in 1923.  While there, she excelled in student government and academics.  She was president of the Y.W.C.A, assistant editor of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Chronicle</title>, a member of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Archive's</title> editorial board, and also belonged to Phi Beta Kappa, the Student Government Council, the Pan-Hellenic Council, the Brooks Literary Society and the League of Women Voters.  She received a B.A. and an M.A. from Duke in 1927 and 1928, respectively, attended summer sessions at the University of Chicago and Cambridge University in England and eventually received a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University.  She taught social science at Somerset High School and history at Ward-Belmont College and Transylvania College. She was eventually appointed the Dean of Women at Vanderbilt University.  She wrote the book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Tennessee Yeomen, 1840-1860</title>, published in 1942 by Vanderbilt University Press.  </p>
