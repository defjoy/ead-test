         <abstract>Charles Alfred Euston FitzRoy (1892-1970), 10th Duke of Grafton, was a soldier and farmer. The collection consists of a single daily diary that records the events of two trips taken by Charles Alfred Euston FitzRoy and his third wife, Rita, in 1949.  Slightly less than half of the diary is used, 171 pages in all, with entries from February 7 through May 28, and from August 8 through October 7. The first portion of the diary describes FitzRoy's daily activities while staying on his ranch near Enkeldoorn in Southern Rhodesia (now Chivhu, Zimbabwe) in March and April and while in Kenya visiting acquaintances in February and on safari in May. The second used portion of the diary records the daily activities of FitzRoy, his family, and friends while hunting in northern Scotland.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection consists of a single daily diary that records the events of two trips taken by Charles Alfred Euston FitzRoy, 10th Duke of Grafton, and his third wife, Rita, in 1949.  Slightly less than half of the diary is used, 171 pages in all, with entries from February 7 through May 28, and from August 8 through October 7.</p>
         
         
         <p>The first portion of the diary describes FitzRoy's daily activities while staying on his ranch near Enkeldoorn in Southern Rhodesia (now Chivhu, Zimbabwe) in March and April and while in Kenya visiting acquaintances in February and on safari in May. Comments on ranch operations are often brief references to visiting "the dip" where livestock is submerged in chemicals to kill parasites, but include references to a cattle drive to Salisbury (now Harare, Zimbabwe). Outside of ranching, much of FitzRoy's time was spent sketching, visiting acquaintances, and sightseeing in nature reserves and towns including Victoria Falls in Southern Rhodesia, Livingstone and Mazabuka in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), and Fort Victoria (now Masvingo, Zimbabwe).  Daily commentary during the 12-day hunting safari in Kenya is more extensive, providing details about stalking and killing several types of antelope, a gazelle, an impala, a zebra, and an African buffalo.</p>
         
         
         <p>The second used portion of the diary records the daily activities of FitzRoy, his family, and friends, including the Duke of Gloucester on a few occasions, while hunting in northern Scotland.  Comments chiefly recount the location of various members of the party and the number and type of animals killed, typically grouse, stags, and rabbits.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
