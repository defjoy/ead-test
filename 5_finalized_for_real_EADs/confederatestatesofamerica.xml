               <p>Original enrolled statutes, 96 items, bearing the signatures of the presiding officers of the House of Representatives and the Senate and the approval of President Jefferson Davis. Ninety of these items belong to the 2d sess., Second Confederate Congress (Nov. 7, 1864-Mar. 18, 1865). These acts have been published in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Laws and Joint Resolutions of the Last Session of the Confederate Congress</title>, edited by Charles W. Ramadell (Durham: Duke University Press, 1941). Also in the collection is the official register of the acts of the Confederate Congress, 1861-1865, 1 vol., giving title and dates of passage and approval of acts of both the provisional (incomplete) and permanent congresses. There are typescript copies of the acts and the register. There is also a register of bills and joint resolutions of the Confederate House of Representatives, 1864, 1 vol. (14 pp.), showing dates of actions taken, passage, and approval. Miscellaneous papers are a petition, 1863, from an unidentified planter of Coahoma County, Mississippi, describing conditions in the delta after the fall of Vicksburg, and a letter, 1865, to William P. Miles, member of Congress, seeking an appointment.</p>
