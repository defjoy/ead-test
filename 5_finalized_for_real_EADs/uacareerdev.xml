         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>The Office of Career Development and Continuing Education, active at Duke University
            from about 1969 to 1975, provided undergraduate and continuing education students with
            assistance in establishing career goals. In cooperation with the University Counseling
            Center, the Office of Placement Services, and deans in the undergraduate colleges and
            professional schools, the Office sponsored the Apprenticeship Program and the Continuing
            Education Program. The Apprenticeship Program arranged volunteer placement in community
            businesses and agencies. The Continuing Education Program placed students in local
            schools to work as teachers, tutors, and assistants. Other internship projects included
            helping local Girl Scouts groups, working in hospitals, counseling older adults, and
            acting as mentors to at-risk youth. Although the Office of Career Development and
            Continuing Education worked with both men and women, the Office was especially
            collaborative with student groups interested in women's programs and studies.</p>
         
         
         <p>Office of Career Development and Continuing Education also worked with other campus
            organizations to bring professionals to speak on campus about the issues of young women
            in a professional work environment, particularly Directions for Educated Women
            Committee, a student and faculty group at Trinity College. Directions for Educated Women
            Committee came together in 1966 when students from Trinity College expressed concerns
            for women's career orientation programs, especially the fact that there was an absence
            of centralized information for women to learn about careers. In response, the Committee
            was formed and promptly arranged a series of speakers. Various women professionals
            addressed preparation for graduate work, admission requirements for graduate schools,
            combining marriage and a career, and suggested opportunities for young women in their
            field. </p>
         
         
         <p>Around 1975, the name of the Office of Career Development and Continuing Education
            changed to the Office of Continuing Education. The Office continued to perform many of
            the same services for students, but with less focus on young women professionals. With
            the development of the Women's Studies Program at Duke University (1983) and the Women's
            Center (1989), career resources for women continue to be available.</p>
