         <abstract>Union soldier in the 102nd Regiment Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops. Collection consists entirely of 21 personal letters from an African American Union soldier, Alonzo Reed, written to his mother while stationed in South Carolina during the latter part of the Civil War.  Some of the letters were written by Reed, some by other individuals, and indicate that Reed's regiment was often on picket duty, though they also provide some descriptions of warfare and the ransacking of plantations.  Reed, who was nearly illiterate, provides brief insights into daily camp life in terms of references of illnesses, hunger, not being paid for many months, and life as a soldier in the midst of war.  Reed occasionally refers to the reception they received from both whites and blacks in the South.  </abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>Collection consists entirely of 21 personal letters from an African American Union soldier, Alonzo Reed, written to his mother while stationed in South Carolina during the latter part of the Civil War.  Some of the letters were written by Reed, some by other individuals, and indicate that Reed's regiment was often on picket duty, though they also provide some descriptions of warfare and the ransacking of plantations during marches.</p>
         
         
         <p>Reed, who was nearly illiterate, provides brief insights into daily camp life in terms of references of illnesses, hunger, not being paid for many months, life as a soldier in the midst of war, and the desire to have news, photos, and writing supplies from home.  Reed occasionally refers to the reception they received from both whites and blacks in the South.  He also writes about fixing railroad supply lines and utilizing surrendered Confederate soldiers to aid in this work.  In November 1864, he inquires as to whether African American men are being allowed to vote in the North and indicates that they are in the South.

               <p>Correspondence consists of 21 letters from Alonzo Reed to his mother both during and just after the U.S. Civil War. Also included within this collection is a brief descriptive sketch of unknown origin concerning Alonzo Reed and the collection. Several of the letters were written while Reed was stationed in Beaufort S.C., and they appear to pinpoint his location as Coosaw, S.C. (designated in the letters with variants such as Car Soil and Crew Saw).</p>
