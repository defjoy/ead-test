                  <p>Letter contains a good description of the final days of the war, and Henderson's impression of the rapid decline of the Confederate cause. Also includes comments on Lincoln's second inauguration ceremonies in Washington, soldier pay and lifestyles, Philadelphia, etc. The letter notes that one of Henderson's friends (from the North) had joined the Confederate cause, fighting for the army and being captured at the Battle of Franklin. Henderson also discusses desertions from the Union army and executions "almost every day, the culprits being principally from the 10th Connecticut...." He also mentions the desertions of Confederate troops, and claims that Georgians and Virginians are more likely to desert, while South Carolinians were considered more loyal and reliable.</p>
