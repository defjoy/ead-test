         <abstract>Tobacco manufacturer, resident of Durham, North Carolina, and Tokyo, Japan. The papers of Edward James Parrish primarily consist of business and personal correspondence (chiefly 1900-1921) of Parrish and of his wife, Rosa Bryan Parrish.  There are also various bills, a notebook on tobacco trade in China and Japan (1894-1900), letter books (1900-1904), and a Bible owned by Parrish, and a scrapbook and postcard album created by Rosa Parrish.  Parrish was a representative of the American Tobacco Company.  The early papers, including turn-of-the-century photo albums, relate to the Murai family and to Murai Brothers, a Tokyo cigarette manufacturing company of which Parrish was the first vice-president.  Two of the photographs albums date from the late 19th century and were owned by Kichibei Murai; they contain photographs of his residences and of banks, mines, oil fields, farms and tobacco factories in which he had an interest.  Also included are photographs of the Parrish's travels in China, and Mrs. Parrish's reminiscences and impressions of her life in Japan.</abstract>

         <p>Edward J. Parrish (1846-1920) and Rosa Bryan Parrish (1852-1927) were residents of Durham, N.C., and traveled to Japan and China in connection with Parrish's work as a representative for American Tobacco and the British-American Tobacco Company.  During his successful operations in Japan establishing a tobacco market, Parrish had conferred upon him by the Emperor of Japan the "Third Order of Honor," and was decorated with the "Medal of Sacred Treasure."  Parrish was born in Pound Hill, in what was then Orange County, N.C., in 1846.  He attended Trinity College, and served for a short time in Company "K," 4th N.C. Cavalry, in the last year of the Civil War.  He married Rosa Bryan in 1870 and moved to Durham around 1871 to establish a grocery and confectionery store.  He then became a tobacco auctioneer, and built the first brick tobacco warehouse in Durham in 1879 (later destroyed by fire).  The Parrish family's primary home in Durham before moving to Japan in 1898 was a large Second Empire structure on Main and Dillard; upon his early retirement around 1904, he remodeled "Lochmoor," on North Roxboro Road (both residences were later demolished).</p>
