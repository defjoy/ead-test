         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection consists primarily of handwritten letters Frank W. Gardner sent home to his wife, Jennie, between 1941 and 1944, during his military service in World War II. These frequent letters detail Gardner's day-to-day life in the United States Army. His last letter is dated, Nov. 8, 1944. The letters Jennie Gardner mailed to Frank around the time of his death were marked "Deceased" and returned by the postmaster. These are present in the collection and document Jennie's life on the home front in Arlington, Mass. during 1944. There are also some letters Jennie Gardner received from the United States War Department notifying her of her husband's death. In addition, the collection features some unidentified snapshots, as well as negatives of a military portrait of Frank Gardner. </p>
