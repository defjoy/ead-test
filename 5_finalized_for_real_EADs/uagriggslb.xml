            <p>Lillian Baker Griggs was born in Anderson, South Carolina in 1867 to William F. and Cora D. Baker. She graduated from Agnes Scott College in 1895 and married Alfred Flourny Griggs in 1897. After her husband's death in 1908, she entered the Carnegie Library School in Atlanta and received her certificate in 1911. From 1911 to 1923 she was Librarian for the Durham Public Library and from 1924 until 1930 served as Director of the North Carolina Library Commission. In 1930 she became the first Librarian of the Duke University Woman's College Library. Committed to undergraduate library service, it was her goal "to have every girl on campus come into the library at least one time." (Box 2 correspondence, Dec. 14, 1937).</p>
            
            
            <p>Griggs actively served in a number of professional organizations, including the League of Library Commissions (President, 1929-1930), the North Carolina Library Association (President, 1917-1918, 1931-1932), the Southeastern Library Association, the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association, the North Carolina Folklore Society, and the League of Women Voters. </p>
