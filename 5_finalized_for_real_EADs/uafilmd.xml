            <p>Organized in 1949, the Duke Film Society's aim was to bring to the Duke University campus the best foreign, experimental, documentary, educational, and art films, both current and past.  Its first chairman was Katharine M. Banham, professor in the Department of Psychology at Duke University.  The Society was a subscription fee based organization that was operated by a faculty initiated committee.  The scope of the Society's aims was limited by both funding and facilities.  In order to fulfill their desire to show both 35mm and 16mm film, as well as, to accommodate an increased number of members in the more comfortable and technologically advanced Page Auditorium the Society joined with Quadrangle Pictures, in 1954, to co-host a number of 35mm films per semester.  The Society disbanded in 1965.</p>
