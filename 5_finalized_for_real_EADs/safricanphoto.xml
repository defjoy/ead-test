         <abstract>Alex Harris is a documentary photographer who co-founded the series of South African documentary projects represented in part by the works in this collection. The South Africa Documentary Photographs Collection consists of four series of 1,035 photographic images documenting South African social conditions under and after apartheid, dating from approximately the 1940s-2007: Beyond the Barricades, The Cordoned Heart, Then and Now, and Underexposed. Each series originated in an exhibition, book, or project developed jointly by Duke University and South African institutions. The collection represents the work of 44 South African photographers, many of whom were members of Afrapix, a collective photography agency that was politically active in the 1980s, or active in documenting anti-apartheid struggle. The fourth series, "Underexposed," includes older photographs dating from the 1940s and 1950s, with a focus on photographers considered less well-known at the time. The images take the form of black-and-white and color prints, chiefly gelatin silver and pigmented inkjet prints, ranging in size from 5x7 inch reference prints to 16x20 inch finished prints. There is a small amount of printed materials, and digital versions of some of the images.  Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The South Africa Documentary Photographs Collection consists of four series of 1,035 photographs documenting South African social conditions during and after apartheid, dating from approximately 1940 to 2007: <emph render="bold">Beyond the Barricades, The Cordoned Heart, Then and Now</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Underexposed</emph>. Each series originated in an exhibition, book, or project developed jointly by the Duke University Center for Documentary Studies and South African institutions such as the Centre for Curating the Archive at the University of Cape Town. The collection represents the work of 44 South African photographers, many of whom were members of Afrapix, a collective photography agency that was politically active in the 1980s, or were otherwise active in documenting anti-apartheid struggle.</p>
         
         
         <p>Among the names in this collection are several documentary photographers whose individual bodies of work are also held at Duke: Alex Harris, David Goldblatt, Cedric Nunn, and Paul Weinberg. All photographers are described in a biographical section above, and they are listed in each series description below. Images consist of rural and urban South African scenes; images of events such as rallies, protests, forced removals, funerals, social gatherings, and labor activities; and portraits of individuals, including some well-known activists and politicians, men and women.</p>
         
         
         <p>The images take the form of black-and-white and color prints, chiefly gelatin silver and pigmented inkjet prints, ranging in size from 5x7 inch reference prints to 16x20 inch finished prints, with some in museum-quality mats.  There is a small amount of textual material documenting the photographs and their earlier exhibition. Many of the photographs are also available as digital images mounted on the library server; please contact a reference archivist for access. There is one digital audio file documenting an exhibit opening for <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Then and Now</title> at Duke University, also available on the library server.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Beyond the Barricades Series</ref> consists of 82 unmatted 12x16 inch gelatin silver prints dating from 1980 to 1988. The photographs were taken as part of a project initiated by the collective photo agency Afrapix, which documented anti-apartheid struggle in the 1980s. Events portrayed include funerals, conflicts with police, rallies and demonstrations, and other political gatherings.

The photographers were South Africans who were primarily members of Afrapix, the collective photo agency that documented resistance to apartheid in the 1980s. The images originated with the Afrapix documentary project "Beyond the Barricades." The project resulted in an exhibit and a book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Beyond the Barricades: Popular Resistance in South Africa</title> (1989), published in cooperation with the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. Afrapix photographers Omar Badsha, Gideon Mendel, and Paul Weinberg selected photographs for the book.</p>

               <p>The Cordoned Heart Series is a collection of 191 matted and unmatted gelatin silver prints of images taken by South African photographers and dating from between 1979 and 1984.  Also contains digital versions of the images and textual materials from the exhibit "South Africa: The Cordoned Heart," curated by Alex Harris, Margaret Sartor, and Cornell Capa.  The images derive from the Cordoned Heart exhibit, which appeared originally at the International Center of Photography in 1986 and toured for a number of years afterwards. The Cordoned Heart exhibit was the culmination of a documentary project by the photographic collective Afrapix, as part of the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in South Africa.  An accompanying book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">South Africa: The Cordoned Heart</title> (1986), was edited in part by Afrapix member Omar Badsha.</p>
               
               
               <p>The series documents a crucial period of protest and social upheaval in South African history, focusing on poverty and the daily lives of people living under apartheid.  Photographs depict neighborhoods, rural and urban residences, social life, families, work conditions, events in South African history such as forced relocations, and scenes of political or labor conflict.</p>
               
               
               <p>Twenty photographers are represented: Paul Alberts, Joseph Alphers, Omar Badsha, Michael Barry, Bee Berman, Michael Davies, David Goldblatt, Paul Konings, Lesley Lawson, Chris Ledechowski, Rashid Lombard, Ben Maclennan, Jimi Matthews, Gideon Mendel, Cedric Nunn, Myron Peters, Berney Perez, Jeeva Rajgopaul, Wendy Schwegmann, and Paul Weinberg.  Textual materials include exhibit brochures and an exhibit installation guide.  There is also a limited edition portfolio with ten signed photographs selected from the exhibit.  Many of the photographs are also available as digital images mounted on the library server; please contact a reference archivist for access. </p>
               
               
               <p>The Cordoned Heart Series is physically arranged by size of prints and matting.  In some cases, prints grouped by size and mat size have variable window sizes.  Photographs are arranged in the finding aid by photographers, listed alphabetically. Textual materials are placed at the end of the series; materials for the Cordoned Heart portfolio are with the original photographs rather than the portfolio prints.</p>
               
               
               <p>All matted prints except the ten Cordoned Heart portfolio prints show dates and captions.  The portfolio prints are captioned in the accompanying text.  Unmatted prints are not dated or captioned, but dates and captions for some are listed in the textual materials at the end of the series, based on the book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Cordoned Heart</title>.</p>

               <p>Consists of 160 prints documenting South Africa before and after apartheid. The series originated in a 2008 exhibition at Duke University curated by South African photographer Paul Weinberg, and includes the work of eight South African photographers: David Goldblatt, George Hallett, Eric Miller, Cedric Nunn, Guy Tillim, Paul Weinberg, Graeme Williams, and Gisèle Wulfsohn. The exhibition featured twenty photographs from each photographer: ten photographs taken during apartheid, and ten taken during the period following democratic elections in 1994.  All of the images are available in an <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://library.duke.edu/exhibits/thenandnow/index.html">online exhibit</extref>.  The series also contains a digitized audio file recorded at the exhibition's opening, also available through the online exhibit.</p>
               
               
               <p>Arranged alphabetically by photographer.  Many of the photographs are also available as digital images mounted on the library server; please contact a reference archivist for access. </p>

               <p>These images originated from a project of the Centre for Curating the Archive at the University of Cape Town to collect the work of South African documentary photographers considered relatively unknown and "underexposed" at the time. Photographs feature a variety of subjects, including South African political protests, family life, leisure pursuits, rural and impoverished social conditions, and working conditions. Eleven photographers are included: Rodney Barnett, Arthur Bolton, Basil Breakey, Anne Fischer, Jenny Gordon, David Hemson, Daniel Morolong (some of whose work was created in the earliest years), Cedric Nunn, Graeme Williams, Janje Wissema, and Gisèle Wulfsohn.</p>
               
               
               <p>The series houses over 600 photographic prints, including both color and black-and-white images. There are approximately 50 digital prints from each photographer, as well as a smaller number of gelatin silver prints. Digital prints are 11.7x16.5 inch pigmented inkjet prints on Epson Archival Matte Paper. Prints were distributed to both the Centre for Curating the Archive in Cape Town and Duke University's Archive of Documentary Arts.</p>
               
               
               <p>Prints are grouped by photographer. The gelatin silver prints of one photographer, Graeme Williams, are arranged in five topical subseries, and appear first. All other photographers are arranged in alphabetical order. All measurements are in inches unless otherwise noted. Graeme Williams images are available on the library server; please contact a reference archivist for assistance.</p>
