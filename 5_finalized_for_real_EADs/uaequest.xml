The Duke University Equestrian Team (DUET) was formed in 1976 to provide a means for equestrians to represent Duke University in competitions. During the 1970s-1980s, membership was open to all Duke University undergraduates and Equestrian Team Alumni, both men and women. During its first four years, the team participated in about six events annually. The club was funded by dues, fundraisers, and ASDU allowances. </p>
            
            
            <p>
The Duke University Equestrian Team participates in the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA), an association of student teams from all over the United States. The IHSA promotes competition for riders of all skill levels, who compete individually and as teams at regional and national levels. The competitions are unique in that no rider may use his or her own horse; all horses are supplied by the college hosting the event. During the early 1980s, the team participated in IHSA competitions at James Madison University, Southern Seminary Junior College, and Randolph Macon Woman's College. </p>
            
            
            <p>
Since the 1980s, the Duke University team has had about 15-20 members per year.
As of 2007, the Duke University Equestrian Team is active.
