         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection includes 3-page survey forms completed by approximately 500 seniors in Durham, Guilford and Wake County high schools, circa 1955.  The survey was titled "Plans of High School Seniors," and included questions about their families' economic status and educational background, living conditions, current activities and post-graduation plans. The forms are arranged by county, then school and sex, then numerically by an apparent score or value penciled on the form.  Additionally, the collection contains a typed draft manuscript of a work, mimeographed copies of a proposal to offer the Ed.D. at Duke and mimeographed copies of papers relating to Wilmer Wilborne, et al vs. H. P. Taylor, et al, a civil rights suit against Washington County (N.C.) schools which include a copy of "A Report on a Comparison and the Program and Facilities of Instruction in the Negro and White Schools of Durham," by John W. Carr, Jr. (Professor of Education at Duke) and other material on Durham schools, along with a report on Arlington County (V.A.) high schools. The material ranges in date from circa 1947-1955.</p>
         
         
         <p>
Not all of the surveys have a penciled value or score on them. Since the purpose of the value or score is unknown, surveys with values or scores may fall under FERPA rules as protected information.  As such, access to those surveys may be prohibited.
