            <p>According to the mission statement of the Black Graduate and Professional Student Association (BGPSA) the organization exists to "address the needs and concerns of minority graduate and professional students and to promote diversity within the Duke University community." These goals are met through community service, social, and academically-based programming events, contributions to the community, and assisting in the development of future minority leadership. The BGPSA is an umbrella organization and its membership includes students from the following organizations: Black and Latino MBA Organization, Black Law Students Association, Black Seminarians Union, Bouchet Society, Student National Medical Association, and Hurston-James Society.</p>
            
            
            <p>
The BGPSA established the annual Julian Abele Awards and Recognition Banquet in honor of the Black American architect who designed Duke University's Chapel and buildings of the original West campus.  Its purpose is to celebrate the Black presence on Duke's campus in general, and the Black graduate and professional student community in particular.  It was chartered around 2003.
