         <p>Griffith Davis was born on the campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia April 18, 1923. He was introduced to photography during high school. After serving in WWII, Davis returned to Atlanta where his photojournalism career flourished as he worked while at Morehouse College for the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Atlanta Daily World</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Time</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Ebony</title>, who authorized him to do a photojournalism spread on his sister's high school, the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private boarding school in North Carolina. Davis' journalistic career introduced him to many political and cultural players of the time, including Langston Hughes, who was one of his earliest mentors. Davis received his M.A. in journalism from Columbia in 1949, the only black student in the program. As a journalist for the Black Star photo agency, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">New York Times</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Ebony</title>, and many other publications, Davis traveled in the United States, Africa, and Europe during the forties and fifties. In 1952 the Republic of Liberia sponsored Davis' one-man show "Liberia, 1952," at the American Museum of Natural History, and the years that followed he produced three documentary films including one narrated by the then unknown actor Sidney Poitier. In 1952 he also joined the Foreign Service, spending most of his time advancing Truman's Point 4 program for foreign aid (later USAID), chiefly in Liberia. He also served in Tunisia and Nigeria, and retired in 1985. In 1993, Morehouse College awarded Davis the Bennie Trailblazer Award, named for his former mentor and president of Morehouse, Benjamin Mays, for personal and professional achievements.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Griffith J. Davis Photographs and Films collection dates from 1949-1991 and comprises films, photographs, nitrate negatives, contact prints, and related materials relating to Davis's trips to Liberia; prominent African American writers, poets, or artists such as Langston Hughes, Hale Woodruff, and Charles Alston; and the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private junior and senior high school for African Americans in Sedalia, N.C.  The audiovisual components include home movies and nine color and black-and-white 16mm films dating from the fifties, taken in Liberia by Davis during part of William V.S. Tubman's presidency.  Davis was asked by Tubman to take films of Liberia in 1952. In 1956 and 1957 he made films while stationed in Liberia with the United States technical assistance mission and the Liberian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  Films depict a wide range of subjects, activities and events, including the country's people, industry, leaders, and rural life.  Included are three videocassettes and one DVD produced from the original 16mm films, and miscellaneous non-audiovisual items. </p>
         
         
         <p>Photographic materials include two sheets of photographic contact prints taken by Davis when he visited Methodist missionaries Mr. and Mrs. George Way Harley in Ganta, Liberia. Subjects include African masks and the Ganta Mission. A letter written by Davis describes his visit with the Harleys.  Other Griff Davis images in the collection are found in an album entitled "Progress in Liberia, November 1949 - February 1950," containing a map of Liberia and twenty large black-and-white gelatin silver prints with typed captions. Subjects feature Liberian landscapes, construction projects, bridges, railroads, and port scenes, with some images featuring native Liberian workers.  The album was assembled to promote the partnership with the Liberian government and the Liberia Mining Company; in the first image, President Tubman is signing a contract with mining officials.  There are also nitrate negatives in the collection that are closed to public use. </p>
