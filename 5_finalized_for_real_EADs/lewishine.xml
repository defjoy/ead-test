         <abstract>The Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program (LHDFP) is administered by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University to support documentary photographers who address humanitarian issues in the U.S. and abroad. The Lewis Hine Fellowship Photographs Collection represents a selection of images from the documentary projects of six LHDFP fellows: Alex Fattal, Maital Guttman, Kate Joyce, Elena Rue, Amanda van Scoyoc, and Lucy Wilson. The photographic images and videos in the collection depict home and community life of disadvantaged families and children in several sub-Saharan African nations (South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia), as well as Boston, Massachusetts. They show everyday life and activities, such as children playing and completing chores, mothers cooking meals, disabled children going to school, household living conditions, and impoverished orphans and HIV-positive children in their familial situations, as well as funerals and school presentations (among other community events). In addition to photographic prints, there are also some documents relating to the projects, and DVDs of the photographers' documentary work.  Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <p>The Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program (LHDFP) is administered by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University to support documentary photographers who address humanitarian issues in the U.S. and abroad.  The LHDFP is the first postgraduate program at Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies (CDS), and is part of a long-standing commitment to youth-focused work at the CDS.  In order to work toward fulfilling this commitment, LHDFP places Fellows with organizations seeking creative solutions to the specific problems faced by women, adolescents, and children in poor, marginalized areas.  Each year, Hines Fellows work with local organizations to document their chosen topic over the course of ten months.  They then return to work with documentarians on their projects.  Hine Fellows, selected each spring, are graduates of Duke University, the Robertson Scholars program between Duke and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, or of the Continuing Studies Certificate Program at the CDS.  The Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program is supported by The Philanthropic Initiative and the Jessica Jennifer Cohen Foundation.</p>

         <p>Alex Fattal graduated from Duke in 2001 with a B.A. in comparative area studies. Alex is a photographer who has made images of rural family life in Russia, Cuba, and most recently, in Colombia on a Fulbright Fellowship. During his time in Colombia, Alex also collaborated with local NGOs on programming related to issues of sustainable development and children's rights. He spent he time as a Fellow in Durban, South Africa, where he worked with a local NGO in its efforts for children's rights advocacy. As part of his work there, he developed the body of work contained within this collection, entitled: <emph render="doublequote">Images of Childhood in South Africa Ten Years after Apartheid.</emph>

         <p>Maital Guttman is a documentary filmmaker. As a freshman at Duke University her interest in documentary work began through the Humanitarian Challenges at Home and Abroad FOCUS Program. During her senior year she produced her first full-length documentary titled Mechina: A Preparation. The film follows six Israeli teens three months before they become soldiers, and sheds light on Israeli society in a way that reaches beyond general images of conflict. As a Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman worked with an NGO in Nekkie, South Africa, and documented the stories of children that attend an arts-based HIV education center in South Africa.</p>

During an intensive semester at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University (CDS) in 2001, she completed a number of undergraduate documentary studies courses and was involved with CDS’s Youth Document Durham program and Student Action with Farmworkers, an organization housed at CDS. She spent that following spring semester in Ghana documenting the unique sign language of the isolated deaf community of Adamorobe. Rue spent nine months as a Fellow in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia working with an NGO that supports children whose families have been affected by HIV. The project she developed while working with these families is called <emph render="doublequote">Love After Loss.</emph>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Lewis Hine Fellowship Photographs Collection spans the years 2003-2008 and consists of selected images from the documentary collections of six of the Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program (LHDFP) fellows in the following locations: Alex Fattal (South Africa); Maital Guttman (South Africa); Kate Joyce (South Africa); Elena Rue (Ethiopia); Amanda van Scoyoc (Boston, Mass.); and Lucy Wilson (Zimbabwe). The photographic images and videos in the collection depict home and community life of disadvantaged and displaced families and children in several sub-Saharan African nations, as well as people in the communities of Chelsea and Boston, Massachusetts. Images show everyday life and activities, such as children playing and completing chores, mothers cooking meals, disabled children going to school, household living conditions, and impoverished orphans and HIV-positive children in their familial situations, as well as funerals and school presentations (among other community events). Several series reveal the after-effects of displacement and social conditions in post-apartheid South Africa (Kwazulu-Natal and Bloemfontein). Two of the photographers' projects also include black-and-white images taken by the children and their families, along with quotes from those individuals regarding the images.</p>
         
         
         <p>The collection consists of 147 color and black-and-white unmatted prints, ranging in size from 6.5x10 inches to 13x20 inches.  There are also 4 DVDs containing both still- and moving-image documentaries with text and audio interviews. Several of the projects include paper copies of the introductions to the bodies of work, as well as full captions for the photographs. Many of the photographs are also available as digital images currently mounted on the LHDFP section of the CDS website.</p>

               <p>As a 2002-2003 Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Fattal became a documentary researcher for the <emph render="italic">Children's Rights Centre</emph> (CRC) in Durban, South Africa from February 2003 to August 2004. The CRC, initially a peace building organization during the violence in KwaZulu-Natal in the 1980s and early 1990s, has grown into a national non-governmental organization mobilizing and advocating for children's rights in every sector of South African society. Fattal's assignment was to explore challenges to children's rights in a qualitative, visual and participatory way, which he undertook over sixteen months by way of traveling to and stay with various households. While staying with these families, he worked with the children leading a series of discussions about photographs in their everyday environment and taught them the basics of framing, lighting, and operating a camera (which they then taught to their family members). Fattal's project (entitled <emph render="doublequote">Images of Childhood in South Africa Ten Years after Apartheid</emph>) consists of photographs in color that he took, and photographs in black and white that children and their parents or caregivers took. Various family members would tell stories about the images they would make, and these narratives are included below with the captions.

               <p>As a Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman spent the 2005-2006 academic year working with the 10 Million Memory Project (10MMP), which is supported by the Regional Psycho-Social Support Initiative (REPSSI) and its partners. The purpose of these non-governmental organizations is to provide a therapeutic approach to healing psychological wounds in the southern region of Africa by way of creating safe spaces for children to share their memories and tell their life stories. More specifically, REPSSI is a non-profit regional organization that works to lessen the social and emotional effects of HIV and AIDS, poverty, and conflict among children and youth in thirteen countries in East and Southern Africa. Guttman was sent to Nekkie, South Africa to work with MADaboutART, an arts-based HIV education and youth empowerment program that is affiliated with 10MMP and REPSSI. While there, Guttman filmed a documentary entitled <emph render="doublequote">Three in a Million: a hero book story.</emph> She also aided in the filming of a short drama developed by the students at MADaboutART (<emph render="doublequote">Broken</emph>) and a short film about the students' efforts to clean up their community (<emph render="doublequote">Gardening Eden</emph>). Her project as a whole is entitled: <emph render="doublequote">Breaking the Silence.</emph>

                  <p>This film is a documentary that highlights three Hero Book stories from MADaboutART, an arts-based HIV education center in South Africa. A Hero Book is a hand made book in which the child is the author, illustrator, and main character. The aim of the <emph render="doublequote">One Child, One Hero Book</emph> campaign is for youth to share with other youth their own strategies in the face of problems. The documentary guides the viewer through the stories of three HIV positive individuals (two children and one young adult) who have created Hero Books. The prompts for the sharing of their stories include: 1. My Self-Portrait; 2. My Community's Problems and Strengths; 3. An Early Memory; 4. My Problem; 5. One Shining Moment - When I Overcame My Problem; 6. Tricks to Overcome My Problem; 7. Me, the Hero. The running time for this documentary is approximately twenty-five minutes.</p>

               <p>As a 2004-2005 academic year Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Joyce worked in South Africa with the nongovernmental organization Diketso Eseng Dipuo Community Development Trust (DEDI).  This NGO focuses on empowering parents and facilitating early-childhood development programs in rural and informal settlements throughout South Africa's Free State province. Joyce was introduced to Grassland Phase II (the subject of her photograph series) through DEDI. Grassland Phase II is a government-subsidized settlement located on the fringe of an expanding black township in South Africa's judicial capital, Bloemfontein. This settlement was developed in an effort to address the land and housing needs of people living in the rapidly growing informal settlement of Bergman Square (a local municipality that was divided into 2,883 half-hectare [1.2 acre] <emph render="italic">sites</emph> in 2003 and renamed Grassland Phase II). Subsidized urban settlements, like Grassland Phase II, provide residents with a springboard for growth and independence from living environments that are no longer sustainable; however, this type of development is still characterized by urban sprawl and racial segregation. The title of Joyce's project is: <emph render="doublequote">Grassland Phase II: Residents and Government Reshaping South Africa's Informal Settlements.</emph>

               <p>As a 2005-2006 academic year Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman worked with Hope for Children (HFC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, beginning in January 2006. Hope for Children is a local, non-governmental organization that supports young children affected by HIV/AIDS by ensuring they have access to basic services, such as food, shelter, education, and medical care. HFC’s seven group homes are the size of a traditional Ethiopian family (six to eight children) and are headed by a group home mother. Once the children are brought together and given everything they need, HFC steps back to allow them to become a family. Rue spent time in each of Hope for Children’s group homes during her nine months in Ethiopia, and her photographs provide a sense of the family life within the group homes and give a face to the statistics within the media about HIV/AIDS orphans. All of the photographs were made by Rue in Ethiopia in 2006 for her project <emph render="doublequote">Love after Loss,</emph> and the names of the children have been changed to protect their identities. </p>
               
               
               <p>This collection includes twenty-one color photographs, one of which is a duplicate. There are seventeen 10.5 x 16" images, three 13 x 20" images, and one 15 x 15" image. Captions are taken from text of multimedia presentation.</p>

               <p>As a Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, van Scoyoc spent the 2007-2008 academic year working with the nonprofit organization Roca, which means "rock" in Spanish. Located in Chelsea, a primarily immigrant, low-income neighborhood in Boston, Roca serves Greater Boston communities by helping at-risk youth become self-sufficient, responsible citizens. During her fellowship project, van Scoyoc worked closely with a group of six teenage mothers from a Roca parenting group to design a documentary project that would give them and 24 other young mothers from Roca an opportunity to tell their stories. She found that many these women focused their lives around the well-being of their children and, being familiar with the cycle of poverty, actively sought out opportunities to secure a better future for them. In order to document their stories, van Scoyoc made a formal portrait in each mother's home and conducted a detailed interview; then, each mother took her own photographs; and finally, van Scoyoc and the young women chose the images and mothers' own words that made up this exhibit. The title for van Scoyoc's project is: <emph render="doublequote">Raising Them Right: Young Motherhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts.</emph>

My mother told me that if she found out I was pregnant she was gonna kick me out of the house. I was like, "No, no, I can't have this baby." But then, you know how when you are pregnant you get curious and you want to know everything? What's growing inside of you?

Then I looked at it again and it came out positive. I let it sit and wait a little bit, and it came out positive.

               <p>As a 2003-2004 Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Wilson spent six months in 2004 working with the Child Protection Society (CPS), a local child rights advocacy organization. CPS was established in 1952 to promote the rights of children in difficult circumstances in Zimbabwe.  Wilson photographed and wrote about CPS’s community-based child care project in the Highfield District, a low-income, high-density suburb of Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital. CPS programming in Highfield includes educational sponsorship, food assistance, youth development, and psychosocial support, as well as community support to child-headed households whose parents have most likely died from HIV/AIDS. As part of the youth development programming, Wilson taught nine children and youth the basics of photography, giving them cameras and black-and-white film. She first asked the youth to write short essays on topics often drawn from the students’ own interests. (The students wrote in English, their second or third language.) They were then encouraged to take photographs based on their writing. Once students developed the images, they selected their best pictures and wrote captions for them (which can be found in the Black and White Prints Subseries). These assignments asked the youth to reflect on the realities of their lives. Wilson's collection from her time in Zimbabwe is entitled <emph render="doublequote">The Highfield District of Harare, Zimbabwe.</emph>
