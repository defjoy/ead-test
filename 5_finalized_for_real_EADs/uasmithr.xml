         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>Collection includes correspondence, reprints,
		  manuscripts, notes, microfilms, and other published
		  materials related to Smith's professional career as an
		  educator and economist. Much of the material is in Spanish,
		  reflecting his activities and research interests in Latin
		  American economic history and development, and the history
		  of Hispanic economic thought. Other matters treated in the
		  files concern the Dan River Textile Mills in Danville,
		  Virginia, Smith's work as a government consultant, and as a
		  teacher of economics in South America and Latin America.,
		  and affairs of the Department of Economics and Business
		  Administration. There is some material related to the
		  courses he taught, and to personal affairs and
		  writings.</p>
