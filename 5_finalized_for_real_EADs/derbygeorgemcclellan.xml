         <abstract>George McClellan Derby (1856-1948) was a U.S. Army engineer recognized for his aerial balloon assents and reconnaissance efforts during the Santiago de Cuba campaign of the Spanish-American War. For the majority of his military career, he was involved in river engineering projects throughout the United States. The collection includes letters to George McClellan Derby, letters to his wife, Bessie (Kidder) Derby, and several letters written by Derby to his mother. Over 50 letters are grouped by originator within the George McClellan Derby series, 29 of which pertain to Derby's military career, mainly in relation to his responsibilities as Assistant Engineer in charge of New York river and harbor works during the mid-1880s. Nearly 90 letters, written by Derby's friend and uncle-in-law, Clarence F. Low, are arranged chronologically by year within the Clarence F. Low series. The collection, chiefly personal in nature, offers insights into the private life of this prominent military engineer and an indication of the challenges involved in conducting underwater explosions. Materials range in date from 1874 to 1907, 1924, and undated.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection includes letters to George McClellan Derby, a military engineer recognized for his aerial balloon assents and reconnaissance efforts during the Santiago de Cuba campaign of the Spanish-American War, as well as letters to his wife, Bessie (Kidder) Derby, and several letters written by Derby to his mother. Over 50 letters are grouped by originator within the <emph render="bold">George McClellan Derby</emph> series, 29 of which pertain to Derby's military career, mainly in relation to his responsibilities as Assistant Engineer in charge of New York river and harbor works during the mid-1880s. Nearly 90 letters, written by Derby's friend and uncle-in-law, Clarence F. Low, are arranged chronologically by year within the <emph render="bold">Clarence F. Low</emph> series. The collection, chiefly personal in nature, offers insights into the private life of this prominent military engineer and an indication of the challenges involved in conducting underwater explosions. Materials range in date from 1874 to 1907, 1924, and undated.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

               <p>The series includes more than 80 letters to Derby or to his wife from her uncle, Clarence F. Low, the Resident Secretary of the New Orleans office of Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance Company of England. Although written or typed on company letterhead paper, most of the letters are personal, revealing a fatherly love and concern for his niece, whom he called Marjorie, and for Derby, his friend and son-in-law as of 1904. Many are signed <emph render="doublequote">Nunkie.</emph> Letters dating from late 1906 to early 1907 provide regular accounts of the Derby's young son, George Townsend, who resided with Low in New Orleans while Derby and his wife vacationed in Italy.</p>
