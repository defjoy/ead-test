The collection contains correspondence, reports, sermons, directories, memoranda, printed matter and clippings.  The papers include programs for the annual Symposium on Christian Missions sponsored by the Divinity school and its Missions Committee.  There are several folders on Duke alumni who were active in the missions of the Methodist and other churches, particularly those in the Far East.  Also included are manuscripts, memoranda, and clippings concerning the Nixon Library controversy of 1981, a civil rights sit-in at Watts Grill in Chapel Hill in 1964 and clippings and newspapers about student unrest at Duke and other campuses between 1968-1970.
