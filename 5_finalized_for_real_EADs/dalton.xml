                  <p>This is the autograph and signed letter collection of Benjamin W. Austin. Many of the letters and autographs were obtained through Mr. Austin’s written request, but older items appear to have come from the autograph collection of Henry Sheldon of Salisbury, Vermont. Although many items are older, most of Mr. Austin’s active collecting was done in the 1880s and 1890s. The group includes items from Congressmen, Civil War heroes, literary figures, and educators. Of special note in the collection is a 1798 message from William Henry Harrison at Fort Washington. Many of the items are accompanied by biographical clippings and several are attached to photographs. Of particular interest are the vintage photographs of Commander Gilbert C. Wittse, naval engineer William H. Shock, and statesman and educator J. L. M. Curry. </p>

                  <p>Stephen Row Bradley and his son William Czar Bradley were lawyers who, as residents of Westminster, Vermont, served in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives respectively. Later Stephen moved to Walpole, New Hampshire. Many prominent New Englanders corresponded with them about Federalist, Republican, and Democratic politics, patronage, and legal and personal matters. Stephen's son-in-law, Samuel Griswold Goodrich ("Peter Parley") was his most frequent correspondent. Other subjects of the correspondence include the Vermont militia, relations between the U.S. and Tripoli, attitudes toward the War of 1812, surveying of the northeastern boundary between the U.S. and Canada, General Lafayette's visit to Thomas Jefferson in 1824, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Andrew Jackson.</p>

                  <p>Collection consists of two undated engravings of Brown, a letter, and a memorandum bound in pink ribbon. The letter is addressed to the Secretary of the Navy and was written in Brown's capacity as Commander. The full title of the memorandum booklet is "Memoranda of occurences and some important facts attending the Campaign on the Niagara." Brown narrates the events of the campaign. There are verified copies of major communications during the campaign, including messages from J.C. Calhoun, James Monroe, General Ripley, and others. Of special interest is a sort of appendix consisting of "An Estimate of the British Regular Troops in Upper Canada, July 1, 1814. With a view of their distribution." It is a detailed look at early nineteenth century military conflicts.</p>

                  <p>Collection is primarily composed of Butler's personal and political correspondence. A few letters relate to his cousins in Louisiana. He sends detailed accounts of the war to his wife, Maria, daughter of S.C. Governor Pickens. Butler vividly describes battles, troop movements, and camp life. After the war, some correspondence deals with his Senate office, including his involvement in the Spanish evacuation of Cuba. Other papers concern his son's murder and legal matters. There are poems, genealogical materials, a 32-page memoir of Reconstruction in S.C. by Butler's daughter, plus an essay by her. </p>

                  <p>Thirty-eight items that relate to the Civil War. Mainly correspondence, the material represents both the Union and the Confederacy. Of note is an 1862 petition signed by 74 citizens of De Soto and Marshall Counties in Mississippi in an effort to have a negro named Isaac returned to De Soto County from the protection of General Sherman. Isaac was accused of the rape and murder of a local woman, Ellen Vines. The items are located in Box 2 of the Harry L. and Mary K. Dalton Collection.</p>

                  <p>This collection centers on a copy of a speech given by General Cleburne to the regimental commanders and general officers of the Army of the Tennessee on January 2, 1864. The copy was requested from Cleburne by General W. H. T. Walker to be forwarded to Jefferson Davis. Walker considered the address inflammatory and likely to result in "ruin" and "disgrace." The document itself, signed by Cleburne, is his famous suggestion that the Confederacy, by that time in dire circumstances, should free the slaves and muster them into the Army. Cleburne outlined the main reasons this would be beneficial: 1) the wind would be knocked out of Yankee moral zeal, 2) foreign countries would be morally free to give substantial aid to the South, 3) the actual size of the Army would be greatly augmented, and 4) the black population of the South would no longer constitute a threat as spies for the enemy. </p>

                  <p>Papers in this collection include letters, as well as financial and legal documents. The oldest item is a French marriage contract drawn in 1763, in the name of Louis Renee Adrien Dugas. Most of the material in the collection, however, pertains to Leon Frederick E. Dugas, who traveled extensively as a cotton merchant and general factor. Letters to Dugas discuss business and prices, as well as numerous lawsuits and disputes with importers. Several letters to Dugas from his brother-in-law and partner Paul Ronignol, are in French. A letterpress volume from 1845 records much of Dugas's correspondence from that year. Many of these letters are in French, and virtually all deal with matters of finance, cotton sales, or estate settlements. Of interest are documents representing Dugas's attempts to gain control of the Habersham Iron Works; papers relating to the sale of slaves to the family; and an inventory showing that in 1827, the Dugas family purchased most of the land, goods, and slaves of <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Good-Rest,</title> the Edgefield, S.C. home of Dr. Beauregard.   </p>

                  <p>Collection consists of a highly readable account of a Union soldier's experiences in the Civil War. It is in the form of a 48-page, typewritten memoir. There is no substantial clue to the identity of the author, but an attached business card is that of an "S.E. Faunce." The memoir describes events surrounding the 13th Mass. Volunteer Infantry, including the author's witnessing of the battle of Hampton Roads between the MONITOR and the MERRIMAC. Some relationship probably exists between the author of this memoir and Daniel W. Faunce, also of Plymouth. </p>

                  <p>Collection contains letters from Fludd mostly written to her friend, Mrs. Jolliffe. Fludd was the sister-in-law of a brother of George A. Trenholm, Secretary of the Treasury of the Confederate States of America. In clear handwriting, Fludd reveals herself to be deeply religious, well-educated, and a witness to the political and social events of the time; her context is Calvinist doctrine. She witnessed the battle and surrender of Fort Sumter and her belongings were destroyed or stolen when Sherman's army passed through Charleston. The letters describe her experiences and trials during the end of the Civil War. She gives an account of her radical change in lifestyle from living with abundance to starvation during Reconstruction, and also of the attitudes of the South to the North. </p>

                  <p>Letters to the Gaffney family of Columbia, S.C., from friends and relatives. A letter (1862) written by P. Lemmons of the 12th South Carolina infantry (Gregg's Brigade) while he was at Camp Arsenal Green in Charleston, S.C., describes the stealing of a steamship, THE PLANTER, by a party of African Americans. Several letters were written by William W. Gaffney to his parents during the Civil War: one (1862 May 20) from Camp Jackson in Spottsylvania, Va., These describe the events of battles in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Two items deal with financial matters at Furman University.  </p>

                  <p>Consists of Civil War correspondence between R. R. Huddleston, 6th Regiment of the S.C. Volunteers, and his wife, Eliza A. (Chandler) Huddleston. The first two letters, headed "York District, S.C.," are love letters written before the couple married in 1861. Soon after this, R. R. left for the war. His letters during the period 1862-1864 are from various places in Va., and contain occasional comments on battles and camp life. In one letter (Sept. 12, 1863) Huddleston recounts to his wife the story of having to watch as two fellow South Carolinians were shot for desertion. </p>

                  <p>Three letters by Iredell addressed to John Branch, Secretary of the Navy; Gales and Seaton; and Willie P. Magnum and William A. Graham. The letter to branch recommends James H. Popelston for a midshipman's warrant. The letter to Gales and Seaton pertains to a subscription to the NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER. To Magnum and Graham, Iredell writes in support of James H. Brazier for appointment as midshipman, and requests that they forward his letter to Secretary of the Navy, Abel P. Upshur. On the same page, Magnum and Graham write a note of transmittal to Upshur, stating that they concur heartily with Iredell's recommendation. </p>

Several letters discuss politics during and after Jackson's presidency, including his relationships with John Rhea and John C. Calhoun. There is also material about military actions in Florida and Georgia during the War of 1812 and on government relations with the Creek Indians.  </p>

                  <p>This collection consists military and other papers of Gen. Thomas Sidney Jesup relating mainly to the War of 1812, The Seminole War, and the Mexican War. It contains correspondence between Jesup and Major Willson, Hugh McCall, William Linnard, James Brown, L. P. Heintzelman, William Schley, and William Ballard Preston, among others. Topics are mostly related to military matters and relations with the Creeks and Seminoles. A detailed memoir by Jesup entitled "Memoir of the Campaigne on the Niagara" complements a similar item in the Jacob Jennings Brown Papers. Combined, the two memoirs yield a stunning overview of the Niagara Campaign, and also point to interesting areas of disagreement. Also included in the collection are two items from Washington, D.C., dated 1831. One represents the sale of 21 slaves to Jesup, while the other is the official District of Columbia authorization for such a sale, which is on Department of State Letterhead, and is signed by Secretary of State Edward Livingston. Additionally, the collection contains an 1813 article of agreement between Jesup and Brintnel Robins of Penn., who contracted to supply 65 boats for the U.S. troops. The boats were intended for the expedition that later led to the Battle of the Chippewa. </p>

                  <p>Collection contains Jones's correspondence and focuses on the Civil War. Some letters are from Jones to his parents, written while a student at S.C. College and a member of a volunteer group concerned with abolition. In all of the letters he wrote with a terse style, relating news and events. He includes detailed accounts of the military activities surrounding Charleston and Fort Sumter, such as iron-clad battles, bombardment of Sumter and hand to hand combat. Letters of family members, including his brother Cadwallader (Waddy) Jones, also give vivid pictures of the military and social aspects of the war in a broad area of the South. There is an account of the June 1862 twelve-day forced march to Fredericksburg. Other correspondence reflects Jones's courtship and marriage to Ellen Adams. He may have been a member of the Ku Klux Klan and letters tell of his arrest and imprisonment in 1871. Other items include legal papers, miscellany such as an unidentified photograph, and papers concerning the United Confederate Veterans, including data on many veterans.  </p>

                  <p>Collection consists of one volume, which appears to be a records of compensation for agricultural labor. Most of the volume consists of lists of staples, foodstuffs, and cash given to laborers on a per diem basis from 1866 to 1878. The last few pages of the book contain written receipts from wages paid by C. T. Kee. All recipients have signed with an "X." This, and a reference to several laborers as "Freedmen" indicate that Kee's laborers were African American. If so, then this volume, covering the 10 years after the Civil War, is valuable documentation of the ways in which African Americans were co-opted into semi-slavery in many parts of the South.  </p>

                  <p>Letter (1840 May 20) from James W. Jeffreys, postmaster at Red House, Caswell County, N.C., to Kendall. The author congratulated Kendall on becoming editor of the Extra Globe and listed his qualifications for the position. Letter (1844 Oct. 7) from Andrew Jackson to Kendall. In his letter, Jackson told Kendall how he planned to try to overawe the "nulifiers" of S.C. with a force of around 150,000 volunteers from a number of states. If this did not work, he planned to punish the leaders only and not "their humble followers." Jackson reminisced about fighting the Creek Red Sticks in the Battle of Talladega and referred to the mutiny and disorder in his camp at Ten Islands. He also revealed that in his 1829 inaugural address, his friends persuaded him to strike a paragraph opposing the Bank of the United States as being unconstitutional. In closing, Jackson spoke of his shortness of breath when he attempted to walk unassisted. Letter from Sears Cook Walker (1849 Aug. 11) soliciting aid in connecting Southern Telegraph Company lines with the Charleston Observatory.  </p>

                  <p>The first item in this collection is a letter from Rome written in 1837 to John Knox of Leesville, S.C. The signature is missing from this item, which relates to the sights and art of Rome. The second item is a letter (1866) addressed to James Knox from Robert H. Miller of Lawrence, Kan. Miller discusses in detail his feelings about the recent Civil War. Most of the letter is devoted to a detailed and stirring account of Quantrill’s 1863 raid on Lawrence, Kan., and the extraordinary events that happened at Miller’s own house. The next three items pertain to W. D. Knox, the son [?] of James Knox. One item is a personal letter of family news written in 1872. Also from that year is a Davidson report card for W. D. Knox’s son, John. The final item (1884) is W. D. Knox’s appointment certificate as school commissioner for Chester County, S.C.  </p>

                  <p>This collection consists mainly of Civil War letters written by T. C. Langley (Company J, 12th Regiment, South Carolina Volunteers), to his family near Lancaster Courthouse, South Carolina. Many of the letters are addressed to his father, William C. Langley, and many South Carolina names are mentioned. Although T. C. Langley wrote regularly from 1861-1865, these letters have little military or political content and pertain mainly to personal matters. Langley's main concerns were his brother John (serving with him, and frequently ill) and the state of agricultural matters back home. The regiment to which Langley belonged traveled widely but little is revealed about camplife, battles, or war perspectives, other than occasional lists of casualties. Of interest at one point in the correspondence is the writer's anger that a Lancaster neighbor had tried to buy first T. C.'s father and then his little brother as substitutes in the army (1862). Miscellany for the collection is mainly pre-war legal material from Lancaster District, including small court suits and the settlement of a James Langley's estate. This folder is located in Box 5 of the Harry L. and Mary K. Dalton Collection.</p>

                  <p>Collection consists of a photostat of pages six and seven of a letter from Mason to an unidentified relative. Mason tells him to proceed to execute a warrant and entry for a grant of land, and he will make an assignment of the entry to him. The land matter involves others, including Messrs. Steptoe and Gosnell. Mason writes that he has delivered to his son a hogshead of tobacco recently received from one of the addressee's tenants, and mentions a snuff mill with which his son Thomson was "concerned" for two years.</p>

Morrow administered the estate of Hennigan's father and the papers reflect the facts of the estate but also family squabbles. The 1888 Articles of Incorporation for the Pineville Cotton mill, as well as two diaries, and an account book are also included. </p>

                  <p>Chiefly letters from Clara Barton, founder and president of the American Red Cross, to Norton who was an intimate friend. Letters contain references to mutual friends and family and document the administration and operation of the Red Cross. Letters written during the Civil War include instructions for sending relief supplies and detailed observations which illustrate Barton's life in the trenches with the soldiers. Later letters concern Barton's travels, speaking engagements, and charity work; her life in Dansville, N.Y., as she contemplated the future of the Red Cross; and her work as the superintendent of the Reformatory Prison for Women in Southfarmington, Mass. A letter from Barton to her cousin Jerry details her breakdown in London, her views on the Stanley and Livingston affair, and her activities in France during the Franco-Prussian War. Other items include pamphlets on women's schools and charity organizations and a letter to Norton from P.T. Barnum discussing Horace Greeley. </p>

                  <p>Collection consists of four letters addressed to Paca. Most are requests from various persons, e.g., a British prisoner asking for his freedom and permission to settle in Annapolis with his family, a Maryland Representative writing on behalf of a woman seeking restitution for personal losses to the British, and a Baltimore man seeking an official pass to visit New York City on business. Another letter inventories the losses in the 1783 fire at the Annapolis armory.  </p>

                  <p>Collection consists of oversized parchment deeds and indentures pertaining to land in what was called the "Northern Liberties" of Philadelphia in the 18th century. Included is a map [ca. 1778?] of land owned by William Coates, a Revolutionary officer and Justice of the Peace for the township of North Liberties. Of particular interest is the plot of land on Coates Street designated as the property of Benjamin Franklin. This is the plot mentioned in Franklin's last will and testament as "my pasture-ground which I have in Hickory Lane, with the buildings thereon..." The remainder of the collection consists of land indentures made by several different parties.  </p>

                  <p>Twenty-three items of correspondence in this collection mainly concern political matters after 1832, when Pickens became openly active in the nullification controversy. Several letters from 1833 deal with Colonel Pickens' efforts to promote the state oath of allegiance and to raise and provision a contingent of his Edgefield constituents. Of particular interest is a letter detailing the types and amounts of military supplies available to various local volunteer groups. The finest items in the collection are three lengthy letters from James Hammond to Pickens in 1839-1840. Some correspondence is personal.  Also included are some legal documents and miscellany items. The collection is housed in Box 7 of the Harry L. and Mary K. Dalton Collection.</p>

                  <p>The major portion of this collection of pictures consists of 53 cartes de viste, dating from the 1860s. Most of them are pictures of Civil War generals. Many of these cartes bear a U.S. postage stamp, indicating that they were produced before or during the period Sept. 1, 1864-Aug. 1, 1866, when all such photographs transported in the U. S. mail were subject to this form of government tax in order to raise additional wartime revenue. Only five of them have not been identified. Also included in this collection are 30 engravings, most of them of prominent American statesmen. Included in the collection are engravings of Kit Carson, Samuel P. Chase, Horatio Gates, and members of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet. Two non-person pictures include an undated print of the Charlotte Female Institute and an 1863 print of Camp Vermont, Virginia during the Civil War.  As of April 2008, these items are located on 6th 16:B.</p>

                  <p>Chiefly correspondence of the Saye family. Early letters trace James Saye's progress through the Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga. Other correspondence details his pastorships in Henry County, Ga., in Unionville and Fairforest, S.C., then in Chester County, S.C. Several letters are from fellow ministers, and discuss Presbyterian Church matters and national politics. Later correspondence is chiefly between the six Saye daughters and their mother, Rebecca Saye (McJunkins), and concern domestic issues and Reconstruction in the South. A letter by Rebecca details the genealogies of the Saye and McJunkins families. One letter (1883) addressed to James Saye from a professor at Davidson College recounts college affairs. Other documents include legal papers, including one Freedmen's Bureau document of 1866 which indentures an orphaned African-American boy to Rev. Saye for fourteen years.  </p>

                  <p>Correspondence, financial records, legal documents, clippings, account books, commissions, addresses and speeches, and a diploma. Correspondence concerns chiefly cotton growing, trade and prices; slaves who worked in cotton fields; financial matters; Washington, D.C. politics, with references to Henry Clay and John Calhoun; state and national politics; descriptions of newly settled areas of Mississippi and California; and a cholera outbreak in Charleston (1832). Civil War letters detail problems at Fort Sumter (1861), and often refer to economic difficulties and shortages in South Carolina. Other Civil War letters are also written from Manassas, Alabama, and Mississippi. One letter from Mississippi details the desperation of women left alone and unable to flee before the advancing Union Army. Post-war letters reveal the problems of Reconstruction in South Carolina. Many of the letters are to Sims' wife Jane Emily Sims (Farnandis). Includes an autobiographical letter from J. K. Paulding, author and statesman, and an essay by the same, entitled "The history of Uncle Sam and his boys." Some of Sims' addresses and one of the legal documents concern Nullification, which Sims' strongly supported. Other documents include an obituary for Franklin H. Elmore, plantation and general account books, and some material on Sims' student days at South Carolina College (ca. 1817-1819), which includes a letter to his brother in 1819 "in defence of General Jackson," and his "treatment of the Indians."  </p>

                  <p>Correspondence, financial papers, and legal documents, concerning William Sims' extensive plantation holdings in South Carolina. Includes two account books. Correspondence is primarily related to business matters, including cotton trade and prices; the price and availability of slaves; and the beginnings of a textile industry on the plantation. Local and state politicians in South Carolina are often mentioned, as is the general economic plight of the Southern planter in the period (ca. 1819-1830), and currency problems in the state (ca. 1826-1830). One personal letter effusively describes newly settled land in Mississippi and the quality of the cotton grown there. Detailed financial papers form the bulk of the collection, and concern the cotton trade (including weights, bale numbers, shipping, prices, and sales), and household and plantation expenses. Legal papers are confined to deeds, documents of land litigation, military commissions, and documents relating to slaves, such as indentures and lists of slaves on the plantation. Also includes genealogical information on the Sims family.Cotton grower in Union County, South Carolina.  </p>

                  <p>Civil War letters from Edwin R. Sloan, a private in Company F, 1st Regiment, N.C. Cavalry, chiefly to his wife Sarah in N.C. Letters span Sloan's military career from 1861 to ten days before his death in September, 1863. Some of Sloan's letters are written from Camp Marsh; Camp W. S. Ash; Washington Co., Md.; Culpepper, Va.; Hanover Junction, Va.; Upperville, Va.; and Raccoon Ford, Va. Letters contain accounts of camp life, deprivations, and rumors and predictions about the war. The author expressed strong Southern sentiments. One letter written in 1861 provides an account of Confederate soldiers fraternizing with the United States soldiers under a flag of truce and being entertained and fed by them. Sloan also described scouting expeditions along the Potomac; Union soldiers burying Confederate dead at Upperville; his sorrow on the death of General Jackson; and his attempt to buy a furlough to come home. In August and September of 1863, Sloan reported of rumors that North Carolina would return to the Union. He expressed his desire for peace, but not at the expense of returning to the Union.  </p>

                  <p>Van Ness was the second in Aaron Burr's duel with Alexander Hamilton and was indicted as an accessory to Hamilton's murder. He fled to New York and later became judge of the U.S. Circuit Court for a New York district. The letter is from Burr from Chilicothe. Here, Burr asks Van Ness to meet him in Berkeley Springs and instructs him to contact certain people in New York and Philadelphia. </p>

                  <p>Predominantly correspondence between Edward Voight and Caroline Voigt of Warren Farm, Chester County, Pa., during their courtship and early years of marriage. A majority of the letters are from Edward's hand. The correspondence between the couple concerns Edward's work as a bookkeeper, and later his mercantile business in Philadelphia; religious devotion and piety; social engagements; the couple's courtship and wedding plans; and travel, particularly by rail between Chester County and Philadelphia. These letters provide a perspective on gender roles and relations during the mid-nineteenth century insofar as they reflect the propriety and etiquette expected of the young couple, as well as Edward's expectations concerning Caroline's religious devotion and her independence on this matter.  </p>

                  <p>Gentleman's pocket book, bound in suede with flap. Scanty accounts fill only a small portion of the book. "Thos. Whiteside--His book" is written on the front, and the name is mentioned several times inside. Book appears to have originally been owned by Jesse Broomfield whose initials appear above Whiteside's on the cover and the earliest entries bear his name. Broomfield was one of the original sponsors of the Ebenezer Academy (1834) near Rock Hill, SC.  </p>

                  <p>Correspondence of members of the Wilkes family, consisting primarily of letters to Charles Wilkes (1798-1877), naval admiral, and of many letters that he wrote.  Letters from prominent scientists such as James Renwick, Asa Gray, James D. Dana, and Jean L. R. Agassiz also appear in the papers, as does correspondence of naval officers, Congressmen, diplomats, and cabinet secretaries, especially Secretaries of the Navy. Included among the numerous subjects mentioned in the papers is the exploring expedition that Wilkes commanded to the Antarctic continent, islands of the Pacific Ocean, and the American Northwest coast from 1838-1842.  There is a lot of family correspondence from various members of the Wilkes family which include two wives of Charles Wilkes. Other types of material in the collection are legal papers, financial records, printed material, writings, account books, a science notebook written by Wilkes' son Edmund in 1847, and a volume entitled, "Notes Relative to the Fijii [sic] Islands," written by Charles Wilkes.  These items  make up part of the Charles Wilkes Papers.  </p>

                  <p>Most of the collection deals with Willard's ownership of the famous Willard Hotel. Extensive correspondence documents the comings and goings of clients at the hotel, as well as repair and financial matters there.  Legal and financial papers are concerned with the hotel, as well as with Willard's other interests as founder of the National Safe Deposit, Savings and Trust, Co., as a member of the D.C. Board of Public Works, and as chairman of the Board of Trustees for the District of Columbia Reform School in the 1870s and 1880s.  Willard received appointments signed by the President every three years.  Thus, the signatures of Grant, Hayes and Cleveland appear here.  A few personal items are included, such as an icy exchange between Henry and his brother Joseph C. Willard. Of interest is a long document to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia which details the feud between the two brothers.  </p>

                  <p>Collection consists of correspondence, notebooks, and miscellaneous papers of Colonel William Augustus Williams of Wilmington and Charlotte, N.C. Correspondence includes letters from Henderson C. Lucas, Williams's nephew, who was wounded at Gettysburg while serving in the 11th Regiment of the N.C.
