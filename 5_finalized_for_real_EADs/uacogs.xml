         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>The College Organization for General Service was
		  founded in 1943 for the purpose of encouraging social
		  service and organizing war work for students of the Woman's
		  College of Duke University. The idea for C.O.G.S. was
		  realized in 1941 during meetings of the American Women's
		  Voluntary Services at First Presbyterian Church in Durham,
		  North Carolina. Mary Grace Wilson, Ruth Addoms, and Alice
		  M. Baldwin represented the Woman's College at the meetings
		  and became interested in starting a smaller chapter for
		  students. Dean Wilson was Chair of the Duke unit of the
		  American Women's Voluntary Services until she stepped down
		  in 1941 to devote more time to the Woman's College. </p>
         
         
         <p>C.O.G.S. was founded in 1941 under the leadership
		  of Woman's College senior Barbara Jarden, Dean Mary Grace
		  Wilson, and faculty member Ruth Addoms. Any female student
		  who arrived on campus automatically became a member of
		  C.O.G.S. The organization was governed by representatives
		  from each women's dormitory, the Town Girl's Club, and
		  graduate students. The aim of the group was to create a
		  meaningful place for women to serve the United States
		  during wartime in an "all-out-for-victory" campaign.
		  C.O.G.S. women performed variety shows for soldiers, rolled
		  bandages for the Red Cross, knitted clothing for soldiers,
		  collected salvage goods, donated blood, organized war files
		  in the Duke University Alumni office, collected magazines
		  for soldiers, hosted open houses at the Woman's College for
		  Camp Butner soldiers, and sold war stamps and bonds. Women
		  who performed a certain number of service projects earned a
		  C.O.G.S. Key to represent her contribution. </p>
         
         
         <p>To plan the academic training of women for war
		  service, Dean Mary Grace Wilson corresponded with service
		  organizations, potential employers, and other universities
		  to develop a curriculum that would teach war-related
		  topics. New courses developed at the Duke University
		  Woman's College included: "Mathematics of Artillery Fire,"
		  "Sea Power and Modern Navies," and volunteer courses in
		  home nursing, first aid, surgical dressing, and civilian
		  protection. Woman's College students were encouraged to
		  take these courses so that they may be better prepared for
		  a job in the armed forces after college.</p>
         
         
         <p>Dean Wilson supported other campus events that
		  unified the students at Duke University. Sing Nights at the
		  Woman's College were major social activities organized by
		  the Women's Student Government Association. "Sings" were an
		  opportunity for groups to lead audiences in easy-to-learn
		  popular and traditional songs. These "sings" were open to
		  all members of the campus community. Fraternity and
		  sorority groups were the most frequent participants.
		  Sometimes in costume, groups would perform a scripted set
		  of songs, competing against each other for prizes. C.O.G.S.
		  women participated in "sings" as well; the official
		  C.O.G.S. song was written by Lucy Blue and Kay Myers in
		  1943. </p>
         
         
         <p> As the war came to an end, the war-related
		  services that C.O.G.S. provided were no longer in need.
		  When C.O.G.S. disbanded in March, 1946, students decided to
		  contribute the treasury to the campus YWCA. Dean Mary Grace
		  Wilson encouraged women to continue community service
		  through other organizations. </p>
