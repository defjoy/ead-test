         <p>Ichthus Limited was formed by David Dole in 1966 as a marketing operation aimed at assisting religious groups. The staff consisted of Dole and several other advertising, research, and marketing executives, as well as executives from Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations. Ichthus Ltd. operated by accepting gifts (with approved tax deductions) such as radio, television, and film projects. The gifts would be marketed by Ichthus, with profits then given as gifts to religious bodies. Dole's overall plan was to encourage religious bodies to make greater use of the media in promoting their work in the community.</p>
         
         
         <p>An IRS regulation affecting the value of artists' estates and other properties led to Ichthus ceasing operations in the late 1970s.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
