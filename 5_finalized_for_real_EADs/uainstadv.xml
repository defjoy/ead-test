		  organize public and alumni relations, fund raising, and
		  long-range planning and development at Duke University. The
		  collection features addresses by E. H. Hopkins, the first

		  files concerning the administration and history of the
		  Office of Institutional Advancement; reports and studies
		  focusing on fundraising and development of Duke University;
		  and the Office's subject files. Major subjects include
		  planned giving, the Fifth Decade campaign, and corporate
		  support. In 1981, the Office of Institutional Advancement
		  was eliminated and its duties largely assumed by the Office
		  of University Development.

         <p>Everett H. Hopkins was appointed Vice President
		  for Institutional Advancement in January 1961 and began his
		  duties in July of that year. The Long-Range Planning
		  Committee of the late 1950s and early 1960s demonstrated
		  the need for organized institutional advancement and
		  large-scale development. Originally, the Vice President for
		  Institutional Advancement was responsible for all public
		  and alumni relations, fund raising, and long-range planning
		  and development. In 1963, long-range planning duties were
		  separated from Institutional Advancement and a new office
		  was created. Hopkins became Vice President for Planning and
		  Institutional Studies. By 1970, offices that fell under
		  Institutional Advancement included Development, Placement
		  Services, Public Relations, and University Editor. In the
		  spring of 1981, President Sanford wanted to redefine the
		  office and its duties. As a result, the Institutional
		  Advancement office was eliminated and its duties largely
		  fell under the office of University Development. The
		  Institutional Advancement program was led by Everett H.
		  Hopkins (1961-1963); Frank L. Ashmore (1963-1973); J. David
		  Ross (1973-1979); and Marion B. Peavey (1979-1981, served
		  as Director; Vice Presidency unfilled after Ross). </p>

               <p>Three addresses delivered by Everett H.
				Hopkins explaining the need for and importance of
				institutional advancement at Duke. Hopkins gave the first
				address to the Duke Faculty Club, dated March 21, 1961,
				before he actually began his duties as Vice President. The
				series is useful in explaining some of the concepts behind
				institutional advancement in higher education and its
				relationship to long-term planning, and showing the
				importance placed on planning and development at Duke
				during the early 1960s. </p>
