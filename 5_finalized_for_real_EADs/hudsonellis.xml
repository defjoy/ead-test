               <p>The black-and-white prints and negatives depicting cases of syphilis in various stages in Syrian men, children, and a few women, are housed in 132 envelopes measuring 7.5 x 5.5. The majority of the envelopes contain both prints and negatives, but a fraction of the envelopes contain only either a print or a negative. The galley proofs include maps of Syria, and charts and tables documenting cases according to religion, sex, age, and place of residence. They were most likely taken during the 1920s and 1930s when Hudson was conducting his principal research in Syria.</p>
