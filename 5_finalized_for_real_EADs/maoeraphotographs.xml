         <abstract>Collection comprises 36 black-and-white photographs, varying in size from about 4x6 to 9.5x11, some with card-stock backing. The images mainly portray women at work, as textile and other industry workers; as scientists, medical professionals, and academics; and as participants in Communist Party education. There are also images that pertain to improvements in women's status, whether for minorities or workers in general. The majority of the photographs bear captions in both Chinese and English. Several have Hsinhua News Agency markings; beyond such markings, the photographer is unidentified. A few have sizing information for reproduction, and many were likely used in an exhibition on the status of women in modern China. Loosely organized according to amount within the following topics, based on the caption provided for the photograph: factory workers, professional women, Communist Party workers, commune and other workers, and minorities. </abstract>
