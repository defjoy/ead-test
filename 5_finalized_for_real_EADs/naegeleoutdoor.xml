         <p>Naegele Outdoor Advertising began in 1934 as an electric sign business, but was converted by founder Robert Naegele to a billboard business following World War II. Originally based in Richfield, Minnesota, the company quickly grew and acquired other smaller outdoor advertising companies throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It specialized in single-pole billboard designs. </p>
         
         
         <p>Naegele operated divisions throughout the United States, with headquarters in Minnesota and Florida. During the 1980s, it was frequently involved in litigation as the company challenged local sign ordinances prohibiting or restricting the use of billboards. It lost its lawsuit against the City of Durham, North Carolina, in 1988.</p>
         
         
         <p>Morris Communications Corporate Family purchased Naegele Outdoor in 1985, intending for it to become the outdoor advertising subsidary. Several Naegele divisions were sold and operated independently for a few years, but it appears that they were subsequently purchased by other outdoor advertising agencies. The name, Naegele Outdoor Advertising, was maintained by Morris until 1991, when it was changed to Fairway Outdoor Advertising. Headquarted in Greenville, South Carolina, Fairway continues to own and operate billboards and other outdoor advertisements throughout the Southeast and Midwest.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
