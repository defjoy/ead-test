         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>George W. Gillette was born at Marines, in Onslow Co., N.C., in 1888, the only son of William Issac Gillette and Rena Winbury Gillette. He attended North Carolina State College and later the Army Engineer School. His military career began in 1916 and lasted until his retirement in 1948. As an officer in the Army Corps of Engineers, Gillette helped organize the Engineer Training Center at Fort Belvoir, Va., commanded the Engineer Training center at Fort Lewis, Washington, and served as Division Engineer both of the New England and South Atlantic Divisions. He was District Engineer in Wilmington in 1945. Subsequently, he brought his engineering expertise and knowledge of waterways construction (as well as his personal connections) to the consulting field. He was associated (through connections) to the consulting field. He was associated (through the World Bank, United Nations, and private agencies) with projects in Latin America, Africa, and South East Asia.</p>
         <p>In 1939, Colonel George W. Gillette of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed and mapped the area from Fort Monroe, Virginia to Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which included the Onslow County coastline and the New River. The map is believed to have fostered the interest of the War and Navy Departments in establishing an amphibious training base in the area.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
