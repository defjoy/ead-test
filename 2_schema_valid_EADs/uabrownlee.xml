         <bioghist>
            <p>Anna Kathryn "Kay" Brownlee was born in 1912 in Philadelphia, Pa. She graduated from Frankford High School of Philadelphia, Pa. in 1930 and enrolled at Duke that fall. She was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma and active in the campus YMCA and dormitory governance. Her brother, John Hubert Brownlee, was also a student at Duke and player on the football team. A devoted fan of Duke football, Kay followed the career of Horace "Horse" Hendrickson, a star player from 1932 to 1933.  Though Kay was an involved student, she did not graduate from Duke University, possibly due to the Depression.</p>
            <p>Kay pursued a career in retail sales in Philadelphia, Pa. with Dewees Department Store during the 1930s. As a personnel manager with Dewees, she directed employees in dress, conduct, policy administration, schedules, and sales promotions.  She often traveled to New York City and Philadelphia to represent the store.  In June 1942 she married F. Clifford Scherer. The Scherers were members of The First Presbyterian Church of Olney of Philadelphia, Pa., where Kay taught Sunday School for ten years. Kay continued to work with Dewees Department stores until their closing. She died in 1971.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <scopecontent>
            <p>Contains photographs, correspondence, artwork, receipts, report cards, class schedules, a plaque, patches, letters, cards, playbooks, programs, invitations, telegrams, and clippings.

These items were originally included in scrapbooks created by Anna Kathryn Brownlee. The first scrapbook was about 100 pages long and contained general items which reflected Anna Kathryn Brownlee's active social and academic life at Duke University from 1930 to 1933.  The second scrapbook was about 75 pages long and was devoted entirely to Duke University football events. Because the original scrapbooks were in poor condition, items were removed and placed in archival folders for preservation.
