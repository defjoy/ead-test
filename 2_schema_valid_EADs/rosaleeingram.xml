         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection includes three publications related to the campaign to free Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram, an African American sharecropper and widowed mother of twelve in southwest Georgia, along with two of her sons, Wallace and Sammie Lee Ingram, who were serving life sentences for the 1947 death of their white sharecropper neighbor, John Ethron Stratford. The handling of the case aroused concern about racial injustice in the southern judicial system which led to the formation of a national campaign for clemency. Through the efforts of the African American community, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the communist-influenced Civil Rights Congress (CRC), the Ingrams' original death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 and eventual release in 1959.</p>
         <p>The three items in the collection were published in 1954, when publicity for the case was largely coordinated by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice, an off-shoot of the CRC headed by the civil rights activist, Mary Church Terrell. The broadside issued by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, includes a quote from Mrs. Ingram; a reprint of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Philadelphia Tribune</title> article about the case dated May 8, 1954; an appeal to readers to contact Governor Herman Talmadge in Atlanta, Georgia; and a contribution form.</p>
         <p>Also included in the collection is a four page newsletter issued by the New York headquarters of the Women's Committee for Equal Justice designed to raise support for the May 9th and 10th <emph render="doublequote">Mother's Day crusade for the freedom of Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and her sons,</emph> in which Mary Church Terrell and supporters plan to campaign for the Ingrams' freedom at the Georgia State Capital and at a national conference in Atlanta. The newsletter includes photographs of a December 1953 protest in Georgia, Mrs. Ingram's children, and Mary Church Terrell; details about the case; quotes from Mrs. Ingram and others; a 28-line statement by Terrell, and a contribution form.</p>
         <p>The earliest item in the collection is a four page newsletter published in February 1954 by the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Congress, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Let Freedom Ring,</title> volume 1, number 3.  The cover page includes an article titled <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Goal for '54: Free Mrs. Ingram</title> that recounts earlier efforts in the fight to free Mrs. Ingram and her sons and announces future campaign activities including plans to demand support from the Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, and the Secretary of the United Nations. The newsletter also includes an editorial on African American history by William L. Patterson, along with several civil rights related articles.</p>
