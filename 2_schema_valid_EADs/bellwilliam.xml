        photographer from Philadelphia. He was employed in 1872 by the U.S.

         <abstract encodinganalog="520">Collection includes sixteen gold-toned
        albumen prints, printed from negatives made by William Bell on the Wheeler
        Expedition of 1872. Fourteen photographs are from Arizona, two from Utah.
        Primary subjects include landscapes of the Grand Canyon and Colorado River.
        Some of Bell's photographs from this expedition were used for prints in George
        M. Wheeler's

        his own dry-plate negatives, a photographic process somewhat uncharacteristic
        for his time. he This process allowed him to store prepared plates longer than
        his contemporaries, who used wet plates, but would have also increased the
        exposure times for his plates.</abstract>

          organization and informational aspects of his work except when they conflicted
          with more modern practices.</p>

         <p>In 1872, William Bell, a photographer from Philadelphia, found
        employment on a survey team established by the Army and formally titled: "U.S.
        Geographical and Geological Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th
        Meridian, under the command of Lieutenant George M. Wheeler." Bell had been
        hired by Wheeler to replace Timothy O'Sullivan, another expeditionary
        photographer, who participated in the Wheeler survey of 1871 and returned in
        1873.</p>
         <p>Perhaps because William Bell participated in only one expedition, a
        limited amount of biographical information has been recorded for him, and that
        information is often vague. William Bell has most often been confused with
        another photographer Dr. William A. Bell (1841-1920) who served on the Palmer
        Expedition of 1867 for which William Jackson Palmer surveyed a route through
        the southwest for the Kansas Pacific Railroad. </p>
         <p>William Bell may have fought in the US-Mexican War and for the Union
        in the Civil War. </p>
         <p>Some sources have also indicated that William Bell was appointed chief
        photographer of the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., where he may have
        made photographs of soldiers wounded in the Civil War. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection includes sixteen gold-toned, albumen prints, printed
        from negatives made by William Bell while on the 
        <corpname>Wheeler Expedition of 1872</corpname>. Fourteen photographs
        are from Arizona, and two are from Utah. The primary subjects of this
        collection are picturesque landscapes made of the Grand Canyon and Colorado
        River. Some of Bell's photographs from this expedition were used for prints in
        George M. Wheeler's 
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Report Upon United States Geographical Surveys
        West of the One Hundredth Meridian...</title>(Washington: GPO, 1875-1889). This
      collection is composed of one series entitled the <emph render="bold">Wheeler
      Expedition of 1872 Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>The government included photographers on western expeditions to make a
        visual record of the landscape and its inhabitants. The photographs created
        during these expeditions served to create maps used to plan for the
        construction of roads and railways; locate natural resources; facilitate future
        military operations; as well as to collect ethnographic information on and
        locate Indian tribes. Perhaps most importantly, the commanders of western
        expeditions used the resulting photographs as a public relations tool to gain
        support for future expeditions, and to record geological information, the study
        of which had become a popular science during the period. By the time of their
        completion, the surveys had explored much of the region between the Great
        Plains and the Pacific Coast. This recording made Bell and the other western
        expeditionary photographers some of the earliest participants in America's
        tradition of documentary photography.</p>
         <p> While in the field, Bell utilized a photographic process somewhat
        uncharacteristic for his time; he prepared his own dry-plate negatives. This
        process allowed him to store prepared plates longer than his contemporaries,
        who used wet plates, but would have also increased the exposure times for his
        plates.</p>
