         <p>Marcus Edwin Hobbs, Duke University educator and

		  (1951-1954), Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and
		  Sciences (1954-1958), Dean of the University (1958), Vice
		  Provost (1962-1963), and Provost (1969-1970), before his
		  retirement in 1970 as Distinguished Service Professor
		  Emeritus. He was named Duke's representative on the
		  original Research Triangle Institute board in 1959, and
		  served as chairman of the board of governor's executive
		  committee. The RTI's 15th building, a $4 million research
		  facility, was named in his honor in 1989.</p>
         <p>Hobbs, who was born in Chadbourne, N.C. in 1909,
		  earned his A.B. in 1932, M.A. in 1934, and Ph.D. in 1936,
		  all from Duke University. He served for 10 years as chief
		  scientific adviser to the Army Research Office advisory
		  council. In addition to other honors, Hobbs received the
		  U.S. Dept. of Army's Outstanding Civilian Service Medal in
		  1959 for his contribution to the establishment of the Army
		  Research Office.</p>
         <p>Hobbs participated in professional organizations
		  including the American Chemical Society, The Chemical
		  Society (London), The American Institute of Chemists, and
		  the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
		  The N.C. Section of the American Chemical Society created a
		  service award in his honor. Hobbs also received the
		  University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service at
		  Duke in 1989.</p>
