         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Chiefly verbatim minutes of staff meetings of the J. Walter Thompson
		  Company (JWT) including Account Representatives' Meetings, Creative
		  Organization Meetings, JWT Forum, Monday Evening Meetings, and Apprentice Group
		  Meetings. Also included are advertisements, photographs, and other printed
		  material attached to minutes as background material for the meetings. Topics
		  discussed at the various staff meetings include account histories, new business
		  prospects, market research, activities of foreign and domestic JWT offices,
		  development and use of advertising media (print, radio, billboards, film,
		  television), social trends, and general business conditions. Some minutes
		  include market research reports.</p>
         <p>The Account Representatives' Meetings deal mostly with specific
		  accounts and offices, and with business conditions. The Creative Organization
		  Meetings and JWT Forum usually consisted of a lecture by a staff member and
		  focused on advertising practices and account histories. The Monday Evening
		  Meetings were a lecture series featuring prominent outside speakers on general
		  interest topics. The Apprentice Group Meetings were luncheon lectures by senior
		  staff members. Among the outside speakers at the various staff meetings were
		  Clarence Darrow, Edward J. Steichen, and Margaret Bourke-White. Speakers from
		  inside the company included Stanley B. Resor, John B. Watson, William L. Day,
		  William C. Esty, and Ruth Waldo. All minutes are from the New York office of
		  JWT. All minutes are from the years 1927-1938. There are some gaps within those
		  years.</p>
         <p>The collection contains a set of photocopies of the all the meeting
		  minutes, designated as <emph render="doublequote">Use Copies.</emph> Also
		  included is a set of originals of all the meeting minutes which are
		  restricted.</p>
         <p>A summary list of the meetings, with selected topics of discussion and
		  speakers, follows the container list. In addition there is also an detailed
		  index compiled by company staff, which may be contemporaneous with the minutes.
		  The indexes for the meetings are filed at the end of each series. The company
		  index is fuller than the summary list, but its form is idiosyncratic and
		  cumbersome.</p>

                  <p>The minutes of weekly Representatives’ meetings form the bulk of
				  all minutes. Representatives and guest speakers from within and outside JWT
				  discuss advertising campaigns and their results, account histories, new
				  business prospects, strengths and weaknesses of advertising media (magazines,
				  newspapers, billboards, radio, and TV), ethics and standards in advertising,
				  and general business conditions.</p>
               </scopecontent>
               <scopecontent>
                  <p>The contents are arranged in chronological order with some gaps.
				  There are occasional inserts to minutes, such as advertisements, photos of
				  store window displays from 1932, and a booklet on “Indian Sign Language” by
				  Chief Buffalo Child/Long Lance, a Hollywood actor (introduction by athlete Jim
				  Thorpe).</p>

               <scopecontent>
                  <p>The minutes cover the period when JWT was expanding abroad,
				  particularly in the 
				  <geogname>Canadian </geogname>and 
				  <geogname>South American </geogname>markets, and include reports
				  from employees of foreign offices. These give their impressions of other
				  countries, the countries’ “progressivism” (by such criteria as
				  industrialization), and their various racial and linguistic groups. They also
				  outline JWT employees’ goals for foreign expansion of US business. Research
				  reports on foreign markets give data such as literacy figures, population
				  densities, and per capita incomes, and refer to social and political trends
				  (including anti-Americanism). There is occasional correspondence from employees
				  in 
				  <geogname>Europe </geogname>and 
				  <geogname>Asia.</geogname>
                  </p>
               </scopecontent>
               <scopecontent>
                  <p>A wide variety of JWT accounts are discussed, making these
				  minutes an important resource for anyone interested in particular campaigns.
				  Minutes include market research reports on JWT clients and their competitors.
				  There are discussions of new products entering the market (e.g. concentrated
				  orange juice), and the development of new advertising media, especially the
				  exploitation of outdoor billboards (important as automobiles became more
				  numerous), radio, and advertising films and TV. The August 9, 1927 minutes
				  discuss cigarette advertising, while those from October 3, 1928 discuss Moxie,
				  a competitor of 
				  <corpname>Coca-Cola. </corpname>The May 1, 1929 minutes discuss
				  the Cream of Wheat HCB Club for children, an example of advertising to children
				  through mothers and schools. Arranged chronologically by meeting date.</p>

                  <p>Creative Organization staff meetings were held on a weekly basis
				  between March 1932 and May 1933, with additional meetings in January and
				  February 1934. Top company officials and creative staff attended the meetings,
				  at which one staff member usually lectured on a subject such as advertising
				  practices and media, trade advertising and advertising to specific groups,
				  client campaigns, research, foreign office activities, and legal aspects of
				  advertising. Some of the meetings included question and answer periods.</p>
               </scopecontent>
               <scopecontent>
                  <p>The contents are arranged in chronological order. The series
				  consists of typed copies of the minutes. Photographs, charts, advertisements,
				  and printed material are sometimes attached to the minutes. Minutes of the Nov.
				  9 and Dec. 14 meetings include photos of store window and counter displays.</p>
               </scopecontent>
               <scopecontent>
                  <p>Presentations include a talk by 
				  <persname>Ward Greene, </persname>Executive Editor of 
				  <corpname>King Features </corpname>(the selling agent for 
				  <corpname>Hearst </corpname>news wire services and director of 
				  <corpname>International News Photos </corpname>and 
				  <corpname>American Radio News Corporation). </corpname>There is a
				  report on consumer behavior at the 
				  <corpname>1933 Chicago World’s Fair, </corpname>and the text of a
				  talk by Mr. Hooper of Daniel Starch’s Advertising Service, analyzing magazine
				  readers’ reception and retention of texts. The social theory of “technocracy”
				  was the topic of two speeches, one in favor by 
				  <persname>Quincy Howe, </persname>editor of Living Age magazine,
				  and one against by 
				  <persname>Mr. Van Deventer, </persname>editor of Iron Age
				  magazine. Relevant articles from their publications are attached. The question
				  of “scientific” advertising, and the 
				  <corpname>American Medical Association’s </corpname>reaction
				  against it, is discussed, as is the related issue of 
				  <corpname>Federal Trade Commission </corpname>regulation of
				  advertising. There is a copy of an October 1934 speech, with handwritten
				  corrections, by Miss F.A. Bell (a JWT employee) on legal aspects of
				  advertising, that was never delivered to the group. Bell did speak on that
				  topic to the Men’s and Women’s Apprentice Groups in 1936, so the 2 speeches
				  allow comparison over time. Both contain examples of legal difficulties arising
				  from 
				  <corpname>Fleischmann </corpname>Yeast testimonials. Some minutes
				  contain ideas for campaigns that were not used or were quickly pulled, such as
				  the November 16, 1932 discussion of a proposed campaign for 
				  <corpname>Eastman Kodak </corpname>that suggested taking photos
				  of family members before they died and were lost forever.</p>

                  <p>Monday Evening Meetings were enrichment lectures by outside
				  speakers presented each week from March through May 1930 in the JWT lecture
				  hall. Speakers included editors and publishers, 
				  <persname>Clarence Darrow, </persname>
                     <persname>Rudy Vallee, </persname>and motion picture censor 
				  <persname>Will Hays. </persname>
                     <persname>Stanley Resor </persname>also gave one talk about his

               <scopecontent>
                  <p>The speeches offer insights into various business, social, and
				  cultural issues of 1930. 
				  <persname>Clarence Darrow </persname>discussed his life story and
				  philosophy, his conception of justice, and the connections between poverty and
				  crime. 
				  <persname>William L. Chennery, </persname>editor of Collier’s
				  magazine, discussed the strategies behind the recent growth of that magazine,
				  while 
				  <persname>James Quirk, </persname>editor of Photoplay, stressed
				  similarities between the movie business and advertising as sellers of ideas and
				  emotions. Resor’s speech gives an Easterner’s impression of the American
				  Southwest and California, and of California universities and hospitals. Besides
				  music, 
				  <persname>Rudy Vallee </persname>spoke of his early acquaintance
				  with 
				  <persname>Rudolph Valentino </persname>and 
				  <persname>Helen Kane. </persname>
                     <persname>Will Hays’ </persname>presentation gives examples of
				  changes made to movies, such as the head of the 
				  <corpname>Boy Scouts of America </corpname>using influence to
				  have a scene of 
				  <persname>Kit Carson </persname>getting drunk cut from “Covered
				  Wagon” because Carson was a role model for Scouts. 
				  <persname>Hays </persname>also discussed his
				  cooperation-operation with the 
				  <corpname>YMCA </corpname>and other organizations and his
				  agreements with the 
				  <corpname>Authors’ League of America </corpname>regarding scripts
				  and with advertisers regarding film ads. He responded to a question about the
				  linguistic problems of making US films for foreign audiences.</p>

                  <p>The Men’s Apprentice Group, made up of new NY Office employees,

				  1938 originally called the Junior News Letter and then the Flash. A Women’s
