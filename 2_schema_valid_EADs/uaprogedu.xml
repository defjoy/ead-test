         <p>The Duke University Program in Education provides opportunities for undergraduates to connect their liberal art studies and the academic work of their major with rigorous intellectual examination of the issues confronting schools, children, and communities. In 1924, under the direction of and with an endowment from James B. Duke, Trinity College became Duke University.  In the Indenture of Trust, J.B. Duke insisted that the training of teachers be among Duke's primary missions.
