         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Omicron Delta Kappa was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1914 as a campus leadership honor society.  It soon expanded to other colleges and the Rho Circle chapter was established at Duke University in 1926.  Omicron Delta Kappa admitted juniors and seniors as well as faculty members and honorary members both alumni and non-alumni on the basis of character, scholarship, distinguished achievement, and consecration to a great purpose.  The five categories of campus life that were emphasized were scholarship, athletics, social and religious activities, publications, and the arts. Election to membership was considered one of the top honors that could be conferred at Duke University.  The focus of the Rho Circle chapter was service to the university and community through the cooperation of all campus leaders. The first president of the Rho Circle chapter was Marshall I. Pickens, later head of the Duke Endowment.</p>
         <p>The Rho Circle chapter maintained a good relationship with other national officers through correspondence of well-connected faculty and administrators, such as Frank C. Brown.  Omicron Delta Kappa became inactive in the late 1960s or early 1970s as a result of general student opposition to the "elitism" of special leadership distinctions. There were also disputes within the national organization about scholarship standards and the fraternity's refusal to admit women.  Although correspondence continued between William J. Griffith, the longtime secretary of the Duke University chapter, and the national officers, the society has never been reactivated at Duke.

               <p>The History and Membership folder contains pages that originally were bound together as a book, dating from 1926-1933. Financial records show the income and expenditures, although some of this information is also contained in the minutes.  The folder titled "Point System," which details the system by which students earned recognition by the society, although there is some indication in the minutes that the student body in general was not aware of this system of points.   Unclaimed certificates are membership certificates never collected by members for various reasons, and show what the certificates looked like over the years.  </p>
