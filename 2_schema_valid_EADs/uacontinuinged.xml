         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Duke University Center for Continuing
		  Education (formerly known as the Office of Career
		  Development and Continuing Education) was established in
		  September 1969, with funds from the Alumni Association of
		  the Woman's College. The Center was oriented toward
		  satisfying the educational needs of women beyond college
		  age and helping women find educational and professional
		  programs in the Triangle area that best fit their career
		  goals and family situations. The Center especially focused
		  on undergraduate women, but later developed into a way for
		  older women to reenter the Duke community by completing
		  interrupted education, re-training or updating skills,
		  changing careers, or developing new interests. Jean O'Barr
		  was director of Continuing Education from 1971 to 1983.
		  </p>
         <p>The Office of Career Development and Continuing
		  Education, active from about 1969 to 1975, provided
		  undergraduate and continuing education students with
		  assistance in establishing career goals. Working in
		  cooperation with the University Counseling Center, the
		  Office of Placement Services, and deans in the
		  undergraduate colleges and professional schools, the Office
		  sponsored the Apprenticeship Program, which arranged
		  volunteer placement in community businesses and agencies
		  and the Continuing Education Program which used student
		  teachers, tutors, and assistants in meeting community
		  needs. Other internship projects included helping local
		  Girl Scouts groups, tutoring school-aged children, working
		  in hospitals, counseling older adults, and acting as
		  mentors to at-risk youth. The Office also worked with other
		  campus organizations to bring professionals to speak on
		  campus about the issues of young women in a professional
		  work environment. Although the Office of Career Development
		  and Continuing Education worked with both men and women,
		  the Office was especially collaborative with student groups
		  interested in women's programs and studies. </p>
         <p>Around 1975, the Office of Career Development and
		  Continuing Education became part of the Office of
		  Continuing Education. The Office continued to perform many
		  of the same services for students, but with less focus on
		  young women professionals. The development of the Women's
		  Studies Program at Duke University (1983) and other
		  activities on campus continued to support young women's
		  professional development. </p>
         <p>The Office of Continuing Education functioned in
		  cooperation with the Counseling Center and Appointments
		  Office (later the Office of Placement Services and the
		  Career Center). The Office of Continuing Education worked
		  closely with student groups and programs of the Woman's
		  College, such as Directions for Education of Women (DEW), a
		  committee organized to inform women of career opportunities
		  and to encourage them to coordinate career and family
		  plans, and the Internship Program in Community Service,
		  organized to place student volunteers of the Woman's
		  College in community services. Service expanded to include
		  year-round training, short courses, certificate programs,
		  and credit courses for male and female students and
		  non-students wishing to further their educations or prepare
		  for standardized tests.</p>
         <p>Jean O'Barr was the Director of the Office of
		  Continuing Education from 1971 to 1983. During that time,
		  she developed conferences about women and work, and guided
		  the Institute for Learning in Retirement and the Peer
		  Counseling Program. In 1983, she left the Office of
		  Continuing Education to become Director of the Women's
		  Studies Program at Duke University. In 1992, the Office of
		  Continuing Education merged with the Summer Session
		  Department to form the Office of Continuing Education and
		  Summer Session. In 2003, the name changed again to the Office of Continuing Studies. </p>

		  records, curriculum planning, and administrative materials

		  Education) at Duke University. Office of Continuing
		  Education was directed by Jean O'Barr from 1971 to 1983,
		  and functioned in cooperation with the Appointments Office
