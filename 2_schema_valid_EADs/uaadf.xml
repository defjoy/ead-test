         <p>The American Dance Festival (ADF) is committed to
		  serving the needs of dance, dancers, choreographers and
		  professionals in dance-related fields. Remaining true to
		  the goals of its founding artists, ADF's programs are
		  developed based on its mission to: encourage and support
		  the creation of new modern dance work by both established
		  and emerging choreographers; preserve our modern dance
		  heritage through continued presentation of classic works,
		  as well as through archival efforts; build wider national
		  and international audiences for modern dance; enhance
		  public understanding and appreciation of the art form and
		  its cultural and historical significance; provide a sound
		  scientific/aesthetic base for professional education and
		  training of young dancers and a forum for integrating and
		  disseminating information on dance education. </p>
         <p> In July 1934, the small town of Bennington,
		  Vermont became the site of the Bennington School of Dance
		  -- the precursor of the American Dance Festival. It was the
		  laboratory in which four of the great modern dance
		  second-generation pioneers (Martha Graham, Hanya Holm,
		  Doris Humphrey, and Charles Weidman) could experiment,
		  train students, and create the early works that made modern
		  dance one of the great cultural triumphs of the twentieth
		  century. </p>
         <p> The Festival, directed by Martha Hill and Mary
		  Josephine Shelly, remained in Bennington until 1942 (with a
		  one-year sojourn to Mills College, California, in 1939).
		  Despite the onset of World War II, Martha Graham spent the
		  summers of 1943-1945 in residence in Bennington, and in
		  1946 Jos Limn brought his first company to Bennington. In
		  1947, Martha Hill initiated a pilot program at Connecticut
		  College in New London, Connecticut, for dance teachers,
		  college dance groups, and young dancers. Due to the success
		  of that pilot program, the Connecticut College School of
		  Dance/American Dance Festival opened officially in 1948.
		  For the 1969 season the name became simply the American
		  Dance Festival, and has been directed by Charles L.
		  Reinhart ever since. In 1978, the ADF took over the
		  sprawling green lawns, studios, offices, and dormitories of
		  Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
