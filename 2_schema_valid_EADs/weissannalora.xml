         <abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">Anna Lora Weiss, born circa 1858, lived in Boston's Dorchester section and owned several rental properties throughout the city. She was also a member of several voluntary and charitable associations, including the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the Commitee on Music for the School Committee of Boston.  Her family, including her mother Mary Clapp Weiss, brothers Richard and Carl, and sister Mary, were of German descent.</abstract>
         <abstract encodinganalog="520">Collection contains two account books, dated 1896-1904 and 1905-1910 respectively, kept by Anna Lora Weiss of Boston, Mass. The account books meticulously document Weiss's income, including significant income she received from her rental properties and other investments, as well as her expenditures on travel, household goods, gifts, and charitable contributions. In addition, the account books indicate that Weiss loaned money at interest to her brother Carl for his often unsuccessful business endeavors. In addition to her finances, the account books also document Weiss's daily activities and social and political interests. Together, the account books reveal that Weiss was an active, independent, and astute businesswoman. Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.</abstract>
