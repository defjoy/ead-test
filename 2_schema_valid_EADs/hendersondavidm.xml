         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Originally from Texas, David Martin Henderson graduated from Duke University in 1968. As a political activist and newspaper editor, Henderson became involved in radical and activist organizations at Duke and in the city of Durham, NC; and was also active on a national scale in several organizations, political parties, and conferences. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The David Martin Henderson Papers span the years 1964 to 1989, and contain organizational papers, correspondence, pamphlets, leaflets and broadsides concerning student organizations at Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Harvard; personal correspondence between Henderson and family members (restricted); and printed material and correspondence concerning a number of other organizations, parties, and conferences, among them the North American Congress on Latin America (1967-1974), the Progressive Labor Party (1973-1976), and other organizations advocating communism and opposing U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and elsewhere. Much of the material was circulated by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and its affiliates at Duke, the Student Liberation Front and its successor, Praxis. The collection concerns such topics as student governance and political action; race relations at Duke and in Durham; the Reserve Officers Training Corps; labor unions and city and campus workers; the movement to end the war in Vietnam; and socialist and communist organizations active at the time.  Printed material includes items concerning the Southern Students Organizing Committee; two copies of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Socialist Worker</title>, the newspaper of the North Carolina Socialist Union for which Henderson was an editor; typed and mimeographed papers of the North Carolina Socialist Union which was succeeded in Durham by the Progressive Workers Committee; the first issue of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Proletarian Cause</title> and draft articles for that publication. Authors including Tom Hayden and Stokeley Carmichael are represented in the papers along with several administrators of University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>
