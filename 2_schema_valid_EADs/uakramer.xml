         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Paul Jackson Kramer Papers include
		  correspondence, reports, writings and addresses, memoranda,
		  research and teaching material, photographs, and printed
		  matter. The collection reflects Kramer's career as a
		  university professor and plant physiologist; his
		  participation in various scientific and learned societies,
		  including his service within the National Science
		  Foundation and on the U.S. Air Force's Committee on the
		  Disposal of Herbicide Orange; and his involvement in the
		  development of the Botany Dept., the Phytotron, and Duke
		  University. Kramer's prominence within the international
		  and national scientific communities is attested to
		  throughout the collection. </p>
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:href="">Correspondence</ref> and the
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:href="">Subject Files</ref> series
		  document the development of the Botany Department; the
		  phytotron; faculty governance; and the Gross-Edens Affair,
		  an administrative controversy at Duke in 1960. The
		  Correspondence and Subject Files series contain Kramer's
		  correspondence with scientists abroad. The subject files
		  document Kramer's role in a number of scientific
		  organizations, the National Science Foundation, learned
		  societies, and the government. The papers are particularly
		  useful as they provide information on cooperation among
		  plant scientists after World War II and the early history
		  of the American Institute of Biological Sciences
		  (AIBS).</p>
         <p>A substantial portion of the collection is
		  comprised of correspondence that pertains to Kramer's
		  research, the direction of graduate students, scientific
		  organizations, matters at Duke University, and other
		  subjects.</p>
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:href="">Research and Teaching Notes</ref>
		  series document Kramer's research and teaching and are
		  useful for the study of his contributions in the field of
		  botany, particularly plant-water relationships, the
		  physiology of forest trees, and botanical research in
		  controlled environments. Research notes and materials are
		  principally located in the Research and Teaching Notes
		  series. However, information related to Kramer's research
		  is scattered throughout the collection. The Correspondence
		  series as well as the Subject Files and Research and
		  Teaching Notes series reflect Kramer's role as a
		  teacher.</p>
         <p>The
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:href="">Photographs</ref> series contains
		  pictures of the Botany faculty.</p>
         <p>A folder list of Boxes 5-11 is available as part
		  of the collection file. Please consult University Archives
		  staff.</p>
         <p>Box 7 is closed pending processing.</p>

               <p>The main body of the Correspondence Series is
				arranged chronologically, however a small number of letters
				are filed together by correspondent and arranged
				alphabetically at the beginning of the series. It appears
				that Kramer created a separate set of files for
				postdoctoral students, and it is these files that are at
				the beginning of the series. Comprised of incoming letters
				and copies of outgoing letters with graduate students,
				university administrators, and scientists, the series
				reflects the full range of Kramer's professional life.
				Letters often relate to research questions, the direction
				of graduate students, the review of manuscripts, and
				matters at Duke University.</p>
               <p>The very beginnings of Kramer's career are
				documented in the 1930s correspondence with Duke University
				biologists Arthur Sperry Pearse, Hugo L. Blomquist, and
				Ruth M. Addoms as well as William Wannamaker, Dean of Duke
				University. This early correspondence is particularly
				interesting as it reflects the correspondents' views on
				developing the biology department and Duke University.
				Beyond Duke, other notable correspondents from the 1930s
				and the 1940s include F.W. Went, Henry W. Popp, J. H.
				Priestly, Walter Loehwing, Burton E. Livingston, and
				Charles A. Shull. Other correspondents during the 1930s
				include Floyd W. Gail of the University of Idaho, B.S.
				Meyer and E.N. Transeau of Ohio State University. Kramer
				corresponded with these botanists, his former professors,
				throughout a substantial part of his career.</p>
               <p>In the 1940s, the series contains numerous
				letters from Kramer's graduate students. Letters from
				Kramer's graduate students during the early 1940s provide
				perspectives on military life during World War II. John P.
				Decker and Theodore Kozlowski were among Kramer's students
				who corresponded with him during the war. Other Duke
				students who corresponded with Kramer include Wilbur
				Duncan, William K. Ferrell, Harold E. Young, and Johnson
				Parker.</p>
               <p>Notable scientists who corresponded with
				Kramer during the 1940s and 1950s include N.A. Maximov,
				from the U.S.S.R.'s Academy of Sciences, as well as Henry
				Oosting, Clifford S. Schopmeyer, Paul Burkholder, William
				T. Jackson, Herman Wiebe, W. Dwight Billings, and Kenneth
				Thimann.</p>
               <p>Correspondence from the 1960s to the 1990s
				reflects a number of matters at Duke including the
				construction of the phytotron. Douglas M. Knight, R. Taylor
				Cole, Henry Hellmers, and George Dutrow are among the Duke
				University figures with whom Kramer corresponded.
				Correspondence with George Dutrow in 1986 includes Kramer's
				reflections on the relationship between the Botany
				Department and the forestry program at Duke. Scientists who
				corresponded with Kramer during this period include William
				Lopushinsky, F.C. Steward, and a number of international
				scholars including Ralph O. Slatyer.</p>

               <p>The Subject Files series reflects Kramer's
				involvement in governance and other matters at Duke, his
				government service, and his service in a number of special
				committees and scientific societies. It includes memoranda,
				correspondence, reports, notes, printed matter, and
				writings. The materials are arranged alphabetically by
				folder.</p>
               <p>Significant subjects within the materials,
				related to Duke University, include the development of
				phytotron research and the establishment of the
				Southeastern Plant Environment Laboratories, the Academic
				Council and the University Council, the Gross-Edens affair
				and the ensuing selection of a new university president.
				The documents pertaining to the Gross-Edens affair are
				particularly significant as they document Kramer's
				observations. Other subjects related to Duke University
				include early interdisciplinary programs, the Department of
				Botany and the School of Forestry, and faculty membership
				in learned societies. Files pertaining to the Sarah P. Duke
				Gardens include letters between Kramer, who served as
				director of the Gardens, and Richard Fillmore, assistant
				director. Also included are letters from Fillmore to Mary
				Carbonna, who wrote a history of the Gardens, and memoranda
				concerning landscape planning in the Gardens.</p>
               <p>The principal societies, programs, and special
				committees that the papers reflect include the American
				Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), the International
				Biological Program and the Committee to Evaluate the
				International Biological Program, the National
				Academy-National Research Council Committee on War-time
				Modifications in Biology, the American Society of Plant
				Physiologists, and the National Academy of Sciences.
				Documents related to the AIBS reflect Kramer's
				participation and its development. Significant figures
				reflected among the AIBS material include Robert F. Griggs,
				Paul Burkholder, Kenneth Thimann, and Detlev Bronk. The
				series also documents Kramer's service within the National
				Science Foundation as well as his service on a number of
				committees of the United States government, including the
				U.S. Air Force's Committee on the Disposal of Herbicide
				Orange.</p>
               <p>Scattered throughout the series are
				manuscripts and notes for Kramer's publications and
				addresses. Topics of the manuscripts include the need for
				controlled environments to conduct botanical research, soil
				and plant water relationships; biological programs during
				World War II; and the role of science in society.</p>
               <p>Accounts of travel abroad, nineteenth century
				nursery catalogs, and class notebooks are included in the
				series. These items along with the biographical information
				within the papers complement the materials that relate to
				the various aspects of Kramer's career.</p>
