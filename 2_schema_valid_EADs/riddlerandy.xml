         <p>The music and recordings in this collection were acquired and donated by Randy Riddle, an Academic Technology Consultant for the Center for Instructional Technology (CIT) at Duke University. The collection includes both race records and radio programs. </p>
         <p>
            <emph render="doublequote">Race records</emph> is a phrase describing 78 rpm gramophone records made for and by African Americans during the early 20th century. These recordings typically contained blues, gospel, jazz, or comedy programs targeting African American audiences. Recording companies marketing race records included Okeh Records, Emerson Records, Vocalion Records, and the Victor Talking Machine Company, among others. By the 1960s, <emph render="doublequote">race records</emph> on the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Billboard</title> chart had been replaced by the phrase <emph render="doublequote">rhythm and blues.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>The radio programs in this collection are a variety of recordings from numerous shows that aired in the 1930s through the 1960s. Some of these discs are the only known copies of the program in existence.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

                  <p>Eleven 16" vinyl discs. A series run on CBS during WWII each weekday. Each half-hour show, sponsored by the Owens Illinois Glass Company and produced by the D'Arcy Advertising Company, includes vocalists Frank Parker and Met Opera star Eleanor Steber early in her career. The main body of each show is a commentary by Fletcher Wiley, who came to prominence in the 1930s in Southern California talking in a folksy style to women about issues they were interested in. Wiley's commentaries focus on the warfront at home and current news on rationing and other issues of interest to the WWII housewife. Some of the later shows in this disc series have reporter Don Pryor filling in for Fletcher Wiley.  These are the only surviving episodes of the series and the discs appear to have been especially prepared for the sponsor, Owens Illinois. The donation includes the original shipping labels (the paper containers had deteriorated) where the discs were sent to an executive at the company. Shipping labels are housed in Box 13.</p>

                  <p>One 16" lacquer disc. One of three episodes of this unusual situation comedy in existence. Originally heard on CBS on Saturday mornings for a season or so following the long-running children's program <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Let's Pretend</title>. The show, sponsored by Listerine Toothpaste and Tooth Powder, stars Billie Burke, better known for her role as Glenda in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Wizard of Oz</title>. The show seems to be aimed at children and their mothers, with storylines about Billie's family getting in awkward situations and learning some kind of lesson.</p>
                  <p>The episode in this collection aired April 27, 1946. When a tramp shows up at her back door begging for food, Billie teaches her brother Julius a little lesson about charity. Marked "Copy" on the disc label. Note that there's an odd transition between the sides - side one cuts off suddenly, but the second side is faded in.</p>

                  <p>Three 16" discs (2 vinyl, 1 lacquer). Four programs (1, 11, 2, and "Mud Pies") in the series <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Uncle Remus</title> featuring Jimmie Scribner. Syndicated during the Christmas season in 1947, the show features Scribner, a white actor, playing all the roles in the program. Scribner was known for doing a Black-themed radio soap where he played all the characters, "The Johnson Family". This show is a real oddity - it appeared to have run only one month and was withdrawn. Scribner re-recorded the shows with the same scripts, omitting any references to <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Uncle Remus</title> and changing the name of the character to "Sleepy Joe". This might have been because <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Song of the South</title> came out in 1947 and Disney might have objected to use of the Remus name on the series. </p>

                  <p>One 16" vinyl disc. An obscure syndicated show from circa 1941 that features Howard Lindsay, star of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life with Father</title>, discussing fatherhood with some famous guests. The programs feature Lowell Thomas and, in the other show, Col. Theodore Roosevelt and Mrs. John Phillips Marquand. Roosevelt is a highlight of the show, recalling stories about his father, President Theodore Roosevelt. No other shows in the series survive.</p>

                  <p>One 16" vinyl disc. Two quarter hour public service dramas syndicated to radio stations. "Square Moon" has a man who goes to his doctor with a sore lip that might be cancer. As he deals with what cancer means, he goes to a cancer research lab where the doctor there offers him a cigarette to calm his nerves. The other drama, "An Accounting," looks at how the Society spends its donations. Both shows look at the stigma around cancer at that time. The shows were produced at the American Broadcasting Company for the Cancer Society.</p>

"Man Against the Crippler" is a half-hour drama featuring Mercury Theater alumnus Everett Sloane. The story is an overview of the history of polio research, produced just a year before the first large-scale polio trials. The second program is "Summer Concert," a program of light concert music featuring Andre Kostelanetz and pianist Alec Templeton. Both include announcements that have tips for protecting against polio during the summer months.</p>

                  <p>Eleven 16" lacquer discs. <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Mad Hatterfields</title> is a rather obscure fifteen minute serial from the 1930s originating at WLW in Cincinnati.  The program was written by Pauline Hopkins, whose other credits include radio's <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">First Nighter</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Grand Hotel</title> and who played Meg on <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Mad Hatterfields</title>. The show was directed by Owen Vinson, later the director-producer of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Let George Do It</title>. The discs came from the collection of Marty Halperin, the vice president of the Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters.</p>
                  <p>In this group are eight fifteen minute episodes from the series on original WLW lacquers from 1938-1939. The program was probably local on WLW and offered up on the larger Don Lee-Mutual network and ran through June 1939, based on radio listings. The program is a humorous radio soap that looks at an eccentric family that works in theater; the shows are sponsored by Nestle's Red Lion evaporated milk and Horlick's Malted Milk.</p>
                  <p>Also in the group are three discs that were used when the producer and writer of the show attempted to reconfigure it as a half-hour weekly program and sell it to potential sponsors on one of the networks. One disc contains different versions of the theme song; the other two discs contain a half-hour sample episode with an announcer that tells about the characters, its run as a fifteen minute show, and people associated with the program, selling it to potential sponsors.</p>

                  <p>Nine 16" vinyl discs. Eighteen quarter-hour shows, syndicated, about 1944-45.  Bidwell McCormick, the host of the show, was a publicity man at RKO and each show includes current "behind the scenes" news of productions at the different studios, along with segments that look at the work of technicians and interesting facts about the life of famous stars. Several of the shows mention or detail problems caused by the War with rationing and ways studios worked around it; they also detail early cast choices or announcements of productions that were later changed, so they document some of the facts around the making of famous films of this period. The only surviving shows from this series.</p>

                  <p>Twenty-two 16" vinyl discs. Broadcast in 1938, this block of 43 programs is from the soap opera "Monticello Party Line", sponsored by Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin, a patent laxative. This soap opera, based around the small-town lives of Monticello, Illinois, the location where Dr. Caldwell was headquartered, ran from 1934 in syndication.  The show was written by Sandra Michael, who would go on in a year or two to create the Peabody winning <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Against the Storm</title>.   </p>
                  <p>The program is based around a telephone "party line," though the actual party line itself is only used as a plot device on occasion in the episodes. The stories revolve around the small problems of couples Curley and Aggie and Clem and Sara and people in the town. Often, characters participate in the show's commercials. At times, the show sounds like it was influenced by character driven comedy serials, like <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Vic and Sade</title> or <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lum and Abner</title>, and, with other characters and plots, more of a traditional women's soap opera. Each year the show offered, as a mail-in premium, a recipe and household tips book, supposedly authored by Sara and Aggie, that featured photos and information on the town and characters. Two examples of these books are available in Box 13.</p>
                  <p>The show was broadcast without interruption through program 675, broadcast March, 1938. At that point, the program went on a summer hiatus and picked up that fall where it left off a couple of months before.  </p>
                  <p>Stations typically ran the program five days per week in the morning or mid-morning soap opera block alongside shows like <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Just Plain Bill</title>. The program was produced by the Cramer-Krassell Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Transcriptions seen in the series were pressed by Columbia, possibly in Hollywood. The first reference to the program in the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Los Angeles Times</title> is the schedule for September 22, 1936 and the last is in 1937 - in this run, it was on four days per week. There are no references to the program on radio schedules in New York or Washington, so it probably ran on smaller market stations or perhaps regionally in the West and mid-West where Syrup Pepsin was distributed. The <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Broadcasting Yearbook</title> mentions the program as late as 1939. </p>
