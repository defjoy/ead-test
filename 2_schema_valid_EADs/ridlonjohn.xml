         <p>John Frederick Ridlon, born in Vermont in 1852, was a physician, surgeon, and professor specializing in orthopedic medicine, practicing in Chicago, Illinois. He served as president of the American Orthopedic Association (1895) and was its secretary for many years. At 65 years of age he served in the U.S. Medical Corps during World War I, advancing to major. He died in Illinois in 1936.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This material, which documents John Ridlon's medical career, consists of both loose and bound articles as well as case files, correspondence, photographs, and illustrations, relating to his research and writings on orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include tubercular infection of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal arthritis), and limb or joint injuries. There are hundreds of medical illustrations in the form of photographs mounted on board, photographic prints of X-rays, and printed illustrations on loose sheets that show patients, symptoms or deformities, and treatments such as surgery, braces and casts; many of them were used by Ridlon in his published works.</p>
         <p>Among the bound volumes are six casebooks (1889-1892); four letterbooks (1873-1903); an autograph manuscript, "Some comments on the principles and practice of Hugh Owen Thomas" (undated); a scrapbook of figures and illustrations (undated); three volumes composed of reprint clippings and manuscript notes (undated); and a bound volume of 88 reprints (1888-1923). There are also many diplomas and certificates received by Ridlon from various educational institutions.</p>
         <p> Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E. Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, H. Cushing. In addition to discussing medical cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the Country Home for Convalescent Children.</p>
         <p>Accompanying the professional papers is a set of 116 black-and-white photographs taken during Ridlon's service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. The photos were taken by several photographers at a medico-military training camp in Plattsburgh, N.Y., in 1916.  Ridlon reported these experiences at a medical conference in 1917, and a reprint of this paper is also held in the collection.  In the same Photographs Series are several portraits of Ridlon, and photographs of him posed in his office and examination room, taken in 1911.  The collection is rounded out by several folders of ephemera, early professional diplomas and certificates, letters of recommendation for Ridlon's Chicago appointment in 1892, and his obituary.</p>

               <p>Folders of case summaries maintained by Dr. Ridlon, most of them dating from 1900 to 1915. At least half are pediatric cases.  Cases include Pott's disease (tuberculosis of the spine), spondylitis, scoliosis (congenital and idiopathic), tubercular infection of the joints, other joint diseases and injuries, and congenital deformities.  Case summaries are typically one to two pages long, and include patient names, ages, residence, family history, symptoms, measurements, treatment, and outcome. Occasionally other documents such as referral letters and records of tests such as urinalyses are attached.  These medical records are open to research.</p>

               <p>Contains 118 black-and-white photographs of the first medico-military training camp at Plattsburgh, N.Y.  Images feature camp scenes, including camp cook stations, mules and wagons, a water truck, machine gun pits, headquarters tents, officers and privates, and drills and reviews of the infantry and cavalry.  Several prints show Ridlon during litter drills.  Names on the backs of certain groups of prints may indicate the photographers: Dr. Suches (?) and Dr. McGraw.  Other individuals are also identified, and most of the images are captioned. Includes a related paper presented by John Ridlon at a conference in 1917, describing the camp and the American preparedness for war with respect to military medicine (photocopied from reprint #82 in the volume, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Collected Papers of Dr. John Ridlon</title>, also in this collection).  The paper was originally illustrated by sixty-seven lantern slides, which are no longer in the collection but may have corresponded to the photographs in this series.</p>
               <p>Series also includes three postcards from the camp at Plattsburgh, three photographic portraits of John Ridlon, two prints of him seated at a desk in his office, and two of him in his examination room, one of which is a duplicate; a wall calendar gives the date as 1911.</p>
