         <abstract encodinganalog="520a" label="Abstract">Newman Ivey White was an educator and
		  Percy Bysshe Shelley scholar. He served as Professor of
		  English at Trinity College and Duke University from 1919 to
		  1948. The papers include correspondence, lectures, research
		  materials, including notecards, copies of letters,
		  manuscripts, and photographs along with printed matter,
		  miscellaneous writings, and other papers, with bulk dates
		  of 1936-1948. Most of the material reflects his work on
		  Shelley and the English Romantic poets; a small amount of
		  reprints and lectures concerns folklore. Much of the
		  correspondence is between White and other scholars of the
		  English poets; correspondents include T. J. Wise, Frederick
		  L. Jones, and George L. Kittredge. H.L. Mencken and George
		  Bernard Shaw wrote to congratulate White on his
		  publications. Several folders of correspondence with
		  members of the publishing firm of Alfred A. Knopf regard
		  the publication of
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shelley</title> in 1940. A
		  letter from Duke faculty member Calvin B. Hoover describes
		  Nazi Germany in 1932, and several of White's European
		  correspondents comment on conditions in Europe during World
		  War II.</abstract>

         <p>Educator, Shelley biographer. Professor of
		  English, Trinity College and Duke University, 1919-1948.
		  Author,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shelley</title> (1940) and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Portrait of Shelley</title>
		(1945), and other works. B.A., M.A. Trinity College,
		Durham, NC, 1913, 1914. M.A., Ph.D., Harvard, 1915, 1918.
		Married, 1922, Marie Anne Updike. Died Cambridge, MA,
		December 6, 1948.</p>
         <p>Known in his time as an eminent Shelley scholar,
		  Newman Ivey White was born in Statesville, North Carolina
		  on February 3, 1892. He grew up in Greensboro, where his
		  father, James Houston White, died in 1912. White entered
		  Trinity College in Durham in 1909, graduating magna cum
		  laude in 1913. During his student days, he was a member of
		  the varsity tennis team for three years; he later coached
		  the school's teams. White entered the graduate program at
		  Trinity, obtaining his M.A. in 1914. He then went to
		  Harvard, where he acquired another M.A. (1915) and the
		  Ph.D. (1918). His dissertation was on Percy Shelley's
		  dramatic poems. While at Trinity he had served as an
		  assistant in English and Latin; he later he filled an
		  instructorship at Alabama Polytechnic institute
		  (1915-1916), and taught English at Washington University in
		  St. Louis. He returned to Trinity in 1919 as a member of
		  the English Department. In 1922 he married Marie Anne
		  Updike, a fellow member of the department from 1927 to 1955
		  who taught modern literature and drama. </p>
         <p> Mr. and Mrs. White shared an interest in
		  folksong, and as a scholar, Dr. White authored
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">An Anthology of Verse by
		  American Negroes</title> (1924, with W.C. Jackson) and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Negro Folk
		  Songs</title> (1928). In 1943, he became the general editor
		of the Frank C. Brown Collection of North Carolina
		Folklore. It was as a Shelley scholar that Dr. White was
		best known, however. Leaving aside scholarly articles, his
		first published work on the poet was an anthology,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Best of Shelley</title>
		(1932). This was followed by
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Unextinguished Heart:
		  Shelley and his Contemporary Critics</title> (1938), in
		which White argued that the poet was not neglected in his
		own time. Finally, he completed in 1940 his two-volume
		biography,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shelley</title>, and followed
		this with a shorter popular biography, the 1945
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Portrait of
		  Shelley</title>.</p>
         <p> Aside from scholarship, Newman and Marie White
		  were known for their interest in progressive causes.
		  Professor White took an interest in election reform, and in
		  child care facilities for working mothers. He was
		  associated with the West Durham Nursery School (1934-1936),
		  and later the Child Care Association, of which he was
		  chairman and member of the board of directors (1944-1946).
		  He was also a moving force behind the establishment of the
		  Durham Labor and Materials Exchange (1933), a clearinghouse
		  for information about jobs, goods and services available to
		  Durham's unemployed. During World War II, Dr. White served
		  on the Duke University Defense Council, and arranged for
		  publication of articles promoting national unity in the
		  crisis. </p>
         <p>White was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the American
		  Association of University Professors, the American Folklore
		  Society, the Modern Language Association and other
		  scholarly associations, both in the United States and in
		  England. His service to Duke University included membership
		  on the University Research Council and on the Executive
		  Committee of the Friends of Duke University Library.</p>
         <p> During the last year of his life, Newman White
		  was engaged in doing research for a biography of William
		  Godwin. He was at Harvard when he died suddenly on December
		  6, 1948. Mrs. White died in 1975, and is buried in
		  Statesville with her husband. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p> Correspondence, lectures, research materials,
		  including photostatic copies of letters, manuscripts, and
		  graphics, along with printed matter, miscellaneous
		  writings, and other papers, with bulk dates of 1936-1948.
		  There is little in the collection that relates to Prof.
		  White's early career. Most of the material appears to have
		  been collected in the course of his work on the English
		  Romantic poets; a small amount of material, comprising
		  reprints and lectures, concerns folklore. Much of the
		  correspondence is between White and other students of the
		  English poets; subjects of the letters include differing
		  opinions and disputes over the interpretation of events in
		  Shelley's life. Other correspondents, among them H.L.
		  Mencken and George Bernard Shaw, congratulate White on his
		  publications. Several folders of correspondence with
		  members of the publishing firm of Alfred A. Knopf concern
		  the publication of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Shelley</title> in 1940. A
		letter from Duke faculty member Calvin B. Hoover describes
		Nazi Germany in 1932, and several of White's European
		correspondents make comments about conditions in Europe
		during World War II.</p>
