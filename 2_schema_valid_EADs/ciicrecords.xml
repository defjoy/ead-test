         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Corps of Intelligence Police (CIP) was first formed by the U.S. Army during World War I, although following the armistice the force was significantly reduced in size. With the start of World War II, however, the army re-expanded the corps and established a training school at Fort Meade, Maryland, to recruit and instruct counterintelligence personnel. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the CIP was renamed to be the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), and grew to include both undercover and uniformed investigators stationed around the country and throughout the world.</p>
         <p>After the war ended, CIC was restructured and control given to the Army's Director of Intelligence. The training school was relocated to Fort Holabird, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore. The Army renamed the facility the U.S. Army Intelligence School in 1955, expanding it to include instruction in field operations intelligence (FOI). By the 1960s, the CIC and FOI were formally merged under Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara into one Intelligence Corps.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
