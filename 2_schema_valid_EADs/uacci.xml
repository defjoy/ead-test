         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Campus Culture Initiative (CCI) received its charge from President Richard Brodhead on April 18, 2006 in response to discussions concerning race and gender, class and privilege, and campus and community that reemerged after the 2006 men's lacrosse case. In the charge Brodhead, "encourage[s] the Steering Committee to articulate a vision of what Duke can be, analyzing existing practices and formulating initiatives needed to realize the vision." The committee was composed of faculty, administrators, alumni, undergraduates, and one graduate student. It met weekly for 32 weeks and generated numerous reports on such issues as admissions, alcohol, race, gender/sexuality, residence life, and athletics at Duke. A final report was submitted to President Brodhead on February 15, 2007.</p>
