         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Walter Scott "Jack" Persons began his coaching career with the Duke Swim team while still an undergraduate in 1931. At the age of 20, he was the youngest head coach at any major university in the United States. Parsons went on to graduate in 1933, but retained his coaching position. During his 45-year career, his teams celebrated 207 meet victories and undefeated seasons in 1933 and 1939. Persons is recognized as one of the pioneers of swimming in North Carolina and served for many years as Chair of the Durham County Red Cross life saving and water safety units.</p>
         <p>Persons became head coach of a second varsity sport in 1940, following the graduation of the player/coach of the Duke Lacrosse team.  Persons held the lacrosse coaching position until 1966; during that time, he produced several All-Americans and led Duke to upset victories over traditional national powers such as Johns Hopkins and Navy.  The highlight came in 1946 when Duke shocked national power Maryland, 12-4 in one of the greatest upsets in collegiate lacrosse history. Under Persons's direction, Duke Lacrosse was consistently ranked as one of the nation's top teams.</p>
         <p>Persons retired from coaching in 1975 and was honored with election to the Duke Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. He also held an unbroken streak of 72 years of perfect attendance at Duke home football games until the fall of 2003 when he missed one game. He passed away in 2005 at the age of 96. </p>
