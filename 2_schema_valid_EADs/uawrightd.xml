         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Dean Scanlan Wright was born in Brownsville, Texas
		  on February 14, 1941, and grew up in Coral Gables, Florida.
		  He attended Duke University and earned a psychology degree
		  in 1962. While at Duke, Wright played football for the Blue
		  Devils from 1958 to 1961, as halfback. During this time,
		  the Duke football team earned two consecutive ACC
		  Championships (1960 and 1961) and won the Cotton Bowl
		  (1961). Dean Wright received many honors as an outstanding
		  player, including the Team MVP Award and invitations to
		  play in the honorary North-South Game (1961) and in the
		  All-America Game (1962).</p>
         <p> After college, Wright was drafted into the
		  National Football League to play for the Houston Oilers,
		  but he injured his knee after one season and returned to
		  Florida. Wright then became a pilot, flying for a number of
		  airlines during his career. Dean Wright died on March 31,
		  2002 in Coral Gables, Florida. He was survived by his wife,
		  Vivian Wright. </p>
