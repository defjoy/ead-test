         <abstract encodinganalog="520">Consists of correspondence, addresses and writings, legal and financial papers, clippings, printed materials, photographs, memorabilia, diaries, and scrapbooks related to Edwin Lee Jones and members of his family, including his father, daughter, son, wife, and brothers. Topics include the activities of the J. A. Jones Construction Company, Duke University student life, the Methodist Church, the Marshall Islands atom bomb tests, ship-building in WWII, and the military career of Edwin's son in the Marine Corps on Parris Island, SC, and in other schools in the South. Although most of the pictures are of the Jones family, there are also photographs relating to an awards ceremony held in honor of J. A. Jones Construction Co.'s prodigious production of "liberty ships" during WWII. The writings and addresses and printed materials document Jones's activities with various religious and philanthropic organizations, while the volumes include a travel journal, as well as several scrapbooks and ledgers recording Jones's personal expenditures from 1918 to 1959. Numerous legal and financial papers pertain to the settling of Jones's estate following his death in 1971. Addition includes letters (5 items; dated 1946) written by Jones describing the preparations for the atomic bomb test and the effects of the explosions on Bikini and Kwajalein atolls.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Consists of correspondence, addresses and writings, legal and financial papers, clippings, printed materials, photographs, memorabilia, scrapbooks, and diaries pertaining to Edwin Lee Jones and his family. Many letters were written by Jones's daughter Louise as a student at Duke University, the Three Arts Club, and a New York City fashion school, and also as the wife of U.S. Army officer Franklin Brown in Oak Ridge, Tenn. There are even more letters from Jones's son Edwin as a youth at Camp Carolina in Brevard N.C., as a student at McCallie Prep School in Chattanooga, Tenn., at West Point, and at Duke University. His letters also document his military career as a Marine Corps recruit at Parris Island, S.C., an officer candidate in Quantico, Va, and an officer in the Pacific during WWII, including duty in Japan. These letters often reflect his stuggle to maintain a Christian lifestyle.</p>
         <p>Other correspondents include Jones's father, J. A. Jones; his brothers, James A. Jones and Raymond A. Jones, both of whom were involved in the family business; his wife Annabel; and others, especially Dilworth M.E. Church of Charlotte. Jones's return correspondence describes his involvement in the Methodist Church, and his activities on behalf of the J. A. Jones Construction Co., much of which involved U.S. military bases and projects in Central and South America. Also present are Jones's descriptive letters to his wife Annabel concerning preparations for, as well as consequences of, the atom bomb test of 1946 near Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific. Additional materials concerning the test can be found among the miscellaneous papers and pictures.
</p>
         <p>Although most of the pictures in the Photographs Series are of the Jones family, there are also pictures relating to an awards ceremony held in honor of J. A. Jones Construction Co.'s prodigious production of "liberty ships" during WWII.</p>
         <p>The writings and addresses and printed materials document Jones's activities with various religious and philanthropic organizations, while the volumes include a travel journal, as well as several scrapbooks and ledgers recording Jones's personal expenditures from 1918 to 1959. Numerous legal and financial papers pertain to the settling of Jones's estate following his death in 1971.</p>
         <p>Addition includes letters (5 items; dated 1946) written by Jones describing the preparations for the atomic bomb test and the effects of the explosions on Bikini and Kwajalein atolls.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
