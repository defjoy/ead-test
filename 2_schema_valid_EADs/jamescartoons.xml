         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection of 14 political posters created as part of the James Cartoons series by the New Process Electro Corporation in New York. The posters, which appear to be by an anonymous artist, were originally part of a subscription available for $1.25 per week. The posters in this collection are all from Volume 7 of the series, dating from 1920-1921.</p>
         <p>The posters are chromolithographs, each sized 21.5 x 31 inches. Their condition is good but fragile, as their fold lines and some marginal tears require careful handling.</p>
         <p>Subjects include foreign policy, especially post-World War I Europe and U.S. attitudes towards the League of Nations; the 1920 presidential election between Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox; and financial topics such as Germany's war debts, coal shortages in the United States, and the Ponzi scheme. The artist uses caricatures to represent political figures or ideas; for example, the country of Russia is regularly shown as an angry bear, while Germany is a toothless dachsund. The election-themed posters often incorporate a donkey and an elephant representing each political party, usually accompanying the various candidates who are engaged in some sort of competition. The 14 poster titles have been captioned below, along with a brief description of the events being portrayed by the artist.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
