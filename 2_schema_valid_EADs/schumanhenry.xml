         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Henry and Ida Schuman began their antiquarian book business in Detroit in the 1930s, and soon moved to New York City where they established their well-known business on 20 East 70th Street and later at 2211 Broadway Street. They have been described as the first history of medicine rare book dealers in the United States. They enjoyed close ties with their clients, most notably to Duke University physician and collector Dr. Josiah Trent, whose collection of rare books and medical artifacts comprise the majority of the items in Duke University's History of Medicine Collections. Henry Schuman died in 1962 at the age of 63. After his death, Ida Schuman carried on with the business until her passing in 1977.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Henry and Ida Schuman Papers consist chiefly of the card index inventory representing the history of medicine-related rare book and manuscript collection that Henry and his wife Ida Schuman assembled and managed as part of their well-known antiquarian book and manuscript business.  The cards were very likely used to assemble the dealer catalogs published by the Schumans, whose business was first based in Detroit, then for the longer duration in New York City. Many of the cards document purchases and other transactions, and which institution or individual acquired the item. The larger card file consists of 15 boxes and is alphabetically organized by author or title. Smaller card files exist for mathematical works and other unidentified indexes.  There are also several boxes of the Schumans' business and professional papers, including several folders of correspondence between the Schumans and their clients and friends, including Josiah Trent, and bills of sale for rare books and manuscripts. The collection also includes papers related to the Schumans' Life of Science Library publishing series.  Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</p>
