         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The formal study of art at Duke began with the
		  establishment of the Dept. of Aesthetics, Art, and Music in
		  1942, with Prof. Katherine E. Gilbert as chair. The
		  department was renamed the Dept. of Art in the 1959/1960
		  academic year, and later renamed the Dept. of Art and Art
		  History in 1985/1986.</p>
         <p>In 2005, the Dept. of Art and Art History provided
		  the following description of its mission: "The Department
		  of Art &amp; Art History, as its name implies, has two
		  distinct yet profoundly complementary units, one primarily
		  devoted to the making of works of art, the other primarily
		  devoted to the historical understanding and current
		  interpretation of visual images and constructed space ...
		  Since 1986, the Department broadened its perspective by
		  introducing courses in theory, methodology, and criticism;
		  by attracting faculty specialists in African and African
		  Diaspora, East Asian, and Latin American art histories in
		  addition to ... European and North American art, from
		  ancient times to [the] contemporary world; and by
		  interacting through interdisciplinary teaching,
		  collaborative research and symposia with other departments
		  and programs, such as African and African-American Studies,
		  Economics, English, Women's Studies, the Center for
		  Documentary Studies and the Center for French and
		  Francophone Studies."
