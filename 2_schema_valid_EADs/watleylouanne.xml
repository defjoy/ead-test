         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The photographs and supporting materials in this collection span the years 1961-2010, with the bulk dating from 2000-2010, and relate to photographer Louanne Watley's work in which she documents religious life of nuns in Catholic convents and abbeys in Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia. The images often focus on the womens' individual features through close-ups of faces, hands, and feet.  There are also a few images of Buddhist and Trappist monks and their communities as well.  The formats are primarily black and white prints with some color prints, ranging in size from 4x5 to 16x20 inches, contact prints, Polaroids (diffusion transfer process), large color inkjet prints ranging from 24x30 to 24x37 inches, and variously-sized negatives.  The photographic materials are arranged into three subseries by format; there are 626 negatives, 638 contact prints, and 23 contact sheets.</p>
         <p>The majority of these materials were originally housed in large three-ring binders.  Watley shot the images with traditional film and used darkroom processes to develop them.  Some negatives were converted to digital form, then into inkjet prints.  The various tonalities, selective cropping, and other variations in the prints from the same negative convey the experimental nature of Watley's approach to photography.
The collection also contains one CD-ROM of Watley's photographic images, a CD-ROM of oral histories conducted by Watley of four Catholic nuns and one Buddhist nun, and a small group of her professional papers, including informational material about the convents, abbeys, and monasteries; correspondences; personal notes sent to Watley from nuns; and other supporting materials.</p>

               <p>Consists of three format subseries of contact sheets and prints, photographic prints, and negatives, encompassing Watley's work documenting communities of nuns from Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia, and of a monastic community in Charlottesville, Va. Images are often close-up shots of individual features, especially heads, hands, feet, and eyes.  There are also digitized oral history recordings conducted by Louanne Watley with Catholic and Buddhist nuns (restrictions apply), as well as a CD-ROM of 33 images selected from the collection.  The digital files have been mounted on a library server; please consult with reference archivist before coming to use these materials.</p>
               <p>The numbering system for individual images matches negative images to contact print images and single prints; thus, negative N1 corresponds with print P1 and contact print image CP1. However, in some cases contact sheets and negative sheets also represent groups of images and so their unique number may not correspond to a specific image with that number.</p>

Topics include the women's religious experiences, life in their community - in particular the role of work, and how they experienced being photographed by Watley.  The original recordings were on audiocassette tape.  There are no dates mentioned in the recordings, but they probably date after 2000.

               <p>Contains information on various abbeys and monasteries visited by Watley during her documentary project. Materials include correspondence with members of the religious institutions about her project; blank postcards; pamphlets; and older publications about related subjects. Some of the correspondence declines a request for a visit or documents the issues raised by a photographer's presence in a religious community.  One folder contains short personal notes to Watley from the nuns she photographed, reflecting on how they experienced the photography sessions and Watley's visits. Also includes copies of Watley's curriculum vitae and an essay she wrote on her photographic work and its course of development over the years. Titles are taken from the original folders.</p>
