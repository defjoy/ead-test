         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Taken from http://diversity.duke.edu/news/profiles/rubio.php</p>
         <p>Philip Rubio was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1950. He moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1988 and worked full-time for the post office from 1980-2000. During that time, he earned a bachelor's degree through Vermont College's distance-learning program and earned a master's degree from North Carolina Central University in 1998.</p>
         <p>In 2000, Rubio took early retirement from the Postal Service and entered Duke's graduate program in history. He received his Ph.D. in 2006.  From 2003-2007, he taught as a teaching fellow and adjunct instructor at the Center for Documentary Studies.  He currently serves as Assistant Professor of History at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection includes 29 audiocassette tapes, one CD, 20 tapelogs, one transcription and 30 signed permission slips from oral history interviews conducted by Rubio for his dissertation, "There's Always Work at the Post Office: African Americans Fight for Jobs, Justice, and Equality at the United States Post Office, 1940-1971" (published in book form in 2010 by the University of North Carolina Press). </p>
         <p>Between 2004 and 2009, Rubio interviewed 31 current and retired postal workers who had worked at post offices in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Washington, DC.  The interviews focus on the significance of post office work in the black community and the black-led fight against the white supremacy at the post office as well as within its unions.  They also dwell on union politics, relations between postal unions, postal working conditions, workplace and community activism, and the Great Postal Wildcat Strike of 1970.</p>
         <p>Those interviewed were as follows (some interviewed together):  Countee Abbott, John Adams and Dorothea Hoskins, Sam Armstrong and Samuel Lovett, Eleanor Bailey, Joann Flagler, Frederick John, Carlton Tilley and Gregory Wilson, Felix Bell, Sr., William H. Burrus, Jr., Don Cantriel, Joseph Henry, Douglas C. Holbrook, Jimmy Mainor, Al Marino, Frank Orapello and Vincent Sombrotto, Raydell Moore, Cleveland Moore, James Morris, Noel Murrain, James Newman, Jeff Perry and Richard Thomas, D. James Pinderhughes, George Booth Smith, Donald P. Stone, Daisy Strachan, and Tommie L. Wilson. </p>
         <p>Typed tapelogs and one transcription accompany these interviews.  Use copies will need to be made for researchers prior to use.</p>
         <p>This collection was acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Center for African American History and Culture.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
