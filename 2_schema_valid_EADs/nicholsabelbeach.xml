         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Abel Beach Nichols (1796/7-1868) was a merchant, farmer, slave owner and dealer.  Originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, he settled in Liberty (present day city of Bedford), Bedford County, Virginia, in 1820.  In 1824 he built a store in Bedford Court House where goods imported from New York were sold, and a few years later began construction of his country house, Three Otters, which is currently listed on the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">National Register of Historic Places</title>. Nichols is recorded in the U.S. Federal Census Slave Schedules as owning 48 slaves in 1860.</p>
