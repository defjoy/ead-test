         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <bioghist>
            <p>The Duke University Men's Glee Club, a social singing group of undergraduate men, was organized in 1927 by J. Foster "Bishop" Barnes, Director of Social and Religious Activities at Duke University. "Bishop" Barnes directed the club until 1956; James Young directed the club from 1957 until 1969. The Men's Glee Club's repertoire included both classical and popular selections. A twelve-member subgroup of the Glee Club, The Triple Quartets, performed serious and comic arrangements.</p>
            <p>
In 1927, the Men's Glee Club won the North Carolina Championship and the Southern Championship, and debuted at Carnegie Hall in New York City. They began to tour widely, visiting western Europe during the early 1930s, and making regular stops at large cities along the east coast.  The first radio broadcast of the Duke University Men's Glee Club was made from New York in 1937 over the Columbia Broadcasting System.  Until 1969, the group had been heard over CBS and NBC radio networks annually.</p>
            <p>
Other singing groups on campus around the late 1960s were the Chapel Choir, the Chancel, and the Women's Glee Club. The Men's Glee Club and the Woman's Glee Club merged to form the Duke Chorale around 1970. The Duke University Chorale is currently active and performs internationally.
