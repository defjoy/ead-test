         <p>	
Youth Noise Network (YNN) is a youth radio project based at the Center for Documentary Studies. YNN brings together a diverse group of Durham teenagers to produce a weekly radio show that addresses current issues of particular concern to teens. YNN participants learn various aspects of the documentary arts and produce their own audio documentaries.
</p>
         <p>
In 2003 a group of teenagers who had participated in the Youth Document Durham summer program at CDS decided that they were interested in continuing to do documentary work throughout the year. They worked with CDS staff members to create Youth Noise Network, which remains a youth-led and youth-driven project. Originally started to explore race, racism, and culture in Durham, YNN has since become a way for teens to creatively express their ideas and document a variety of topics, including education, family, immigration, civic engagement, young artists, and politics. </p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
