         <p>Alberta Bassett (Stith Jones Gillingham was the daughter of Dr. Nicholas Long Bolling Stith, who graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1829 and who lived in Halifax County and then in Raleigh.  He had at least two other children, Anna Guion and Fred H. Stith.  Dr. Stith and his brother, A.B. Stith, bought 1000 shares of stock in the Ward gold mine in 1854, one of the largest mines in the Cid mining district of Davidson County, N.C.  Mrs. Gillingham inherited at least part of the properties which she came to hold in the Cid mining district.  It appears from the papers that her mining interests included gold, silver, copper, sulphur, and zinc.  One of the mines she came to own was the Ward mine.  Her first marriage in 1881 was to J. Howard Jones, also a mine owner, who died in 1884.  She also became involved with a lawyer from Charlotte, William H. Bailey.  She married her second husband, Captain H.R. Gillingham, in 1905.  By then, Alberta and her brother and sister had become estranged, and a long legal battle ensued during the late 19th and early 20th centuries over the ownership of the mines.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->
