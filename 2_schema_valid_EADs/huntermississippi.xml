         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Jody Jones Hunter is a collector of works by certain southern authors taught by William Blackburn. The Mississippi authors represented in this collection include William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Willie Morris.</p>
         <p>William Faulkner (1897-1962) was born in New Albany, Mississippi, and spent most of his life in Oxford, Mississippi. He wrote both novels and short stories, most of them based in Mississippi. Some of his works include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Sound and the Fury</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">As I Lay Dying</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Light in August</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Absalom, Absalom!</title>. He was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature, as well as two Pulitzers for his novels.</p>
         <p>Eudora Welty (1909-2001) was born and spent most of her life in Jackson, Mississippi. She was a photographer for the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s, eventually choosing to work on her writing. She wrote novels, short stories, and non-fiction, eventually winning the Pulitzer Prize (1973), the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1980), and numerous other awards. Some of her works include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Ponder Heart</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Optimist's Daughter</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Petrified Man,</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Why I Live at the PO.</title>
         </p>
         <p>Willie Morris (1934-1999) was born in Jackson and grew up in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He left the state for college and eventually studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. After serving as editor of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Harper's Magazine</title>, Morris returned to the South and became a writer-in-residence at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Some of his works include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">My Dog Skip</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">North Toward Home</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">My Mississippi</title>.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection includes a wide range of materials, most seeking to document the lives and influences of Mississippi authors. Specifically, the majority of the collection consists of magazines, newsletters, newspaper clippings, and other published interviews and coverage of Eudora Welty and Willie Morris. William Faulkner material is present, but to a much smaller extent, and no primary resource information about Faulkner is available in this collection.</p>
         <p>The Eudora Welty materials include correspondence, publications, prints, photographs, and other miscellaneous materials. The correspondence was collected by Jody Jones Hunter, and although it is only a few pages of materials, includes letters in which Welty confides to her recipients about her Fulbright, her resistance to autographing books and articles, her Pulitzer and Gold Medal for Fiction awards, and other personal reflections on her travels and events. Also of note in this series are the first and limited edition materials, including the original serialized version of Welty's <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Delta Wedding</title> in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Atlantic</title>. The majority of the Welty materials are newspapers and clippings, magazine articles, and other brochures and ephemera that discuss Welty or include interviews with her.</p>
         <p>The Willie Morris materials also include some first edition and proof copies of his works, including <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">My Two Oxfords</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Good Old Boy</title>. Like the Welty materials, the majority of this series consists of magazine and newspaper articles about Morris, as well as miscellaneous Morris-related brochures and ephemera. There are also some photographs of him with Pete, his dog, and with Eudora Welty.</p>
         <p>The remainder of the collection consists of general Mississippi and Southern magazine coverage. One folder of materials relates to William Faulkner, consisting largely of Faulkner newsletters from the University of Mississippi. Also included are several videotapes of commercially-produced renditions of Welty's and Morris's work, such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">My Dog Skip</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Why I Live at the PO</title>, along with taped newscasts or interviews of the authors.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->
