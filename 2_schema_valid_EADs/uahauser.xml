He received numerous awards and citations such as the Certificate of Merit for his work on a government project during World War II on the synthesis of anti-malarials, the American Chemical Society's Florida Section Award as the year's (1957) "outstanding chemist of the South" the National American Chemical Society Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry (1962), the Herty Medal (1962), and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufactures Association Medal (1967). He died in 1970 at the age of 69.  </p>
