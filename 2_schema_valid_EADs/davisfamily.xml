         <p>The Davis family of Hampton, Virginia traces its history back to
		  William Roscoe Davis, a former slave and religious and civic leader in Hampton,
		  who lived from 1812 to 1904. The children of his son Andrew Davis and Frances Nash
		  were: Oma Davis, William Davis, Thomas H. Davis, Don Andrew Davis, Harry
		  Winfred Davis, John Davis, Collis Huntington Davis, and Arthur Paul Davis, and Nancy Davis.
		  Don Davis was an administrator at Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Arthur Paul Davis, Sr.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Arthur P. Davis (1904-1996) was born and raised in Hampton, Virginia.
		  A Phi Beta Kappa, he received a degree in philosophy from Columbia University in 1927 and briefly taught
		  at North Carolina College for Negroes (later North Carolina Central University)
		  before returning to Columbia to earn a master's degree in English in 1929. For fifteen years he taught at Virginia Union University and in 1942 earned his Ph.D. in
		  18th-century English literature from Columbia, the first black American to do
		  so. He joined Howard University in 1944 where he taught until 1980 and was part
		  of a legendary faculty that included Sterling Brown, Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin
		  Frazier, Mordecai Johnson, Alain Locke, and James Nabrit, among others. His

		  McKinley Neal was also a pharmacist, and the first African American elected into the state
		  legislature. Together they owned the Regal Pharmacy in Kansas City, Missouri
		  which her husband continued to operate until his own death in 1982. Georgia's

         </p>
         <p>Collis Huntington Davis, Sr. was born in 1900 in Hampton, Virginia and
		  attended the Whittier School and Hampton Institute Academy. He was one of the first
		  African American students to attend Grinnell College in Iowa and in 1923 became
		  the first African American Grinnell student to be inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.
		  He returned to Hampton Institute as a chemistry instructor in 1923. He did
		  graduate work at Harvard University and earned a master's degree in chemistry
		  from Columbia University. He pursued a P.h.D. in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania but did not complete the work. He served as chemistry department head and later as

		  met Collis H. Davis, who was enrolled in a summer class at Harvard University.
		  After graduation she moved to Virginia to teach dance and physical education at
		  Hampton Institute, and in 1930 married Collis Davis. In addition to dance,
		  Billie developed an interest in photography. She studied with the Hampton
		  photography instructor, Reuben Burrell, and built a darkroom in her home. When
		  physical ailments curtailed her dance activity, she concentrated on her
		  photography for the remainder of her life, expanding her range with
		  experimental techniques. She died in 1955. The playground that she worked to
		  build in Phoebus, Virginia was dedicated to her in 1980.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Davis Family Papers span the years 1876 to 2007, with the bulk of the material
		  dating from 1924 to 2004, and are arranged into three series of photograph albums, loose photographs, and family papers that document the personal histories of members of the African
		  American Davis family. Of the albums in the
		  <emph render="bold">Photograph Albums Series</emph>, four were created by Louise Davis
		  and one was assembled by Georgia Campbell Neal, Louise's grandmother. Louise Davis's
		  photograph album dating from 1947-1949 contains snapshots that pertain to her stay at
		  Fryeburg Academy and at the Encampment for Citizenship summer program. Her
		  1949-1953 photograph album documents student life at Colby College in Maine. Many
		  images in the <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> were taken by
		  Billie Davis and by Louise Davis, who were particularly interested in photography, but some were contributed by others,
		  including Reuben Burrell of Hampton Institute. Subjects include members of the
		  Davis family and their friends, both at special events and in everyday home and
		  school life in Hapmton, Virginia from the 1930s to the 1950s. The family papers found in the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> consist of correspondence, documents, and published articles related to Davis family
		  members. These include magazine features on Louise Davis from 2001 and 2004, as
		  well as photocopies of Louise Davis's many articles written for major East
		  Coast newspapers and other publications. Materials related to Thulani Davis
		  include photocopies of her articles for the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Village Voice</title> and the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">San Francisco Sun Reporter</title>, and reviews of
		her books. Papers related to Anthony Davis include reviews and feature articles
		on his performance and composition career including his operas
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X</title>,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Under the Double Moon</title>,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tania</title>,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Amistad</title>, and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Wakonda's Dream</title>. Genealogical materials
		include a photocopy of a handwritten draft of Georgia Campbell Neal's
		autobiography, reports on several of the Davis family reunions in the 1990s, as well as
		detailed family trees of the Davis and Stone families.</p>

               <p>Series comprises six photograph albums of the Davis
				family. One photograph album was created by Georgia Campbell Neal and includes
				images from 1924 through the 1950s that document her life in Kansas City,
				Missouri where she and her husband James McKinley Neal, both pharmacists, owned
				the Regal Pharmacy. Other subjects include her daughter, Billie Louise Barbour,
				and her grandchildren, Georgia Louise Davis, Jennie Davis, Collis Davis, Jr.,
				and Thulani Davis. Four photograph albums created by Louise Davis include
				snapshots mostly taken by her or her mother that document Louise's life in
				Hampton, Virginia and her later activities, particularly her attendance at
				Fryeburg Academy (1947-1949), the Encampment for Citizenship summer program
				(1949), and Colby College (1949-1953). The majority of the images are in black
				and white. Some photographs including those taken in Jamaica, Burma, and India
				were presented to Louise Davis by friends upon their return from visits. Finally, the sixth item is a wedding album of photographs from Louise Davis' marriage to Chuck Stone in 1958.</p>
               <p>Processing note: Overhead photocopies were made of each photograph album
				page to preserve original order and to allow for donor annotations. The
				photograph albums are not bound; the individual pages are encased in mylar
				sleeves.</p>
               <p>Related materials may be found in the Photographs Series.</p>
