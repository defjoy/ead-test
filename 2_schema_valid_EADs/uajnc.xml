         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <bioghist>
            <p>The son of famed Methodist minister Rev. John Nelson Cole, John Nelson Cole, Jr. was born in 1895 and grew up in Rockingham, NC.  He entered Trinity College in 1905 and was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity as well as the Glee Club.  He was also friends with Angier B. Duke.</p>
            <p>
After graduating in 1909 with a degree in journalism, Cole went on to teach English at the Woodberry School in Orange, VA for a short time.  From 1910 to 1912, he attended Columbia University's journalism program.  He subsequently worked for the Baltimore Hotel, the N.Y. Edison Company, and as a reporter for the New York Evening Post.  Later, he worked as advertising writer and salesman for the U.S. Printing and Lithograph Company.  Eventually, he became founder and president of the Planographic Equipment Company, which manufactured printing presses and produced pictorial sections for large newspapers.

            <p>Cole included these items in string-bound patent scrapbook of over 100 pages.  The original scrapbook has been unbound and photocopied for preservation, due to the fragile and acidic paper.  Scrapbook and photocopy were then re-boxed into two boxes.  No further processing.</p>
