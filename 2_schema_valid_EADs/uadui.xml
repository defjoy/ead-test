         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Duke University Improv, an improvisational comedy
		  group made of Duke University undergraduates, was formed in
		  February 1997, after a dormitory talent show on East
		  Campus. In late 1996, East Campus held an "East Campus
		  Extravaganza" at Reynolds Theater in the Bryan Center. Each
		  dormitory on East Campus was to showcase its talent for the
		  show; judges would award a pool table to the winners.
		  Members of Gilbert-Addoms dormitory created a
		  "mock-appella" group to enter the contest and sing parodies
		  of the Speak of the Devil and Pitchfork songs. During
		  preparation for this event, Sean Loughlin and Matt Kolavick
		  met Cason Carter; the three became part of a 10-person
		  group. The group claims to have not prepared much for the
		  show, but their performance captivated the audience and
		  they won the pool table for Gilbert-Addoms dormitory. One
		  song, "Breakfast at The Marketplace", was a hit that would
		  resurface in later performances. </p>
         <p> After the East Campus Extravaganza, several
		  residents in Gilbert-Addoms and Randolph (plus one person
		  from Alspaugh) talked during the year about creating an
		  improvisational comedy group. They were impressed by the
		  television show
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Whose Line is it
		  Anyway</title> and Duke University orientation week's
		Comedy Spots. In February 1997, John Grant and Sean
		Loughlin called a meeting in Gilbert-Addoms hall. The
		founding eight members of Improv were: Harris Brodsky,
		Cason Carter, John Grant, Scott Hecker, Sean Loughlin, Matt
		Kovalick, Porter Mason, and Nupur Mehta. </p>
         <p> The new group called themselves DUI: Duke
		  University Improv and claim to have had some rough
		  beginnings. But by spring 1997, DUI performed ten times on
		  campus and conceived the idea for the Big Show, a
		  successful variety and benefit show. Porter Mason, Scott
		  Hecker, and Cason Carter were discussing their families and
		  discovered that cancer had affected them all. DUI was doing
		  well financially, and with no costs, they could produce a
		  benefit show that they would call the "Big Show". All
		  proceeds would be donated to the Scott Carter Foundation
		  for Cancer Research in memory of Cason's brother, Scott,
		  who died from bone cancer. Over the next three years,
		  Improv produced three Big Show events and raised
		  approximately $25,000 for cancer research. Improv made two
		  trips to Tulsa, Oklahoma to perform in benefit shows and
		  present checks to the Scott Carter Foundation for Cancer
		  Research. </p>
         <p> Additional performances were a Big Show III
		  sell-out in Page Auditorium featuring local celebrities,
		  Christmas Shows, Mystery Shows, and Duke Parent's Weekend
		  shows. Improv also made their mark on the Duke University
		  campus in The Chronicle as the subjects of many letters to
		  the editor and an in-person comedy showdown with "Monday,
		  Monday" columnists, The Tossed Salad Men. In the community,
		  Improv performed for the Durham Academy, television's Cable
		  13 channel, and students at the University of North
		  Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Virginia, and
		  Georgetown University. </p>
         <p> As of 2003, DUI is currently active on campus and
		  continues to perform the Big Show and well as a new Little
		  Big Show. </p>
