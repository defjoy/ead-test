         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Mel Rosenthal was born in the South Bronx and grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, close to the neighborhood where he made the photographs in his book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">In the South Bronx of America</title>.  He received a P.h.D. in English Literature and American Studies from the University of Connecticut, then taught at Vassar College and the University of Connecticut before taking a journey of self-exploration to Africa.  In Tanzania, Rosenthal learned photography by working as a medical photographer at the University Hospital. His experiences in Africa ignited a passion for the documentary image and its uses and from that time on he has been a photographer.</p>
         <p>Rosenthal's work most often focuses on how changing social conditions influence individuals.  His early South Bronx documentary projects grew out of his teaching work at Empire State College in the South Bronx in the 1970s.  This work includes <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">In the South Bronx of America,</title> in the collections at the Rubenstein Library, which documents the destruction by arson of an entire South Bronx neighborhood in New York in the 1970s, where Rosenthal once lived, with images of burned-out buildings and neighborhood residents. The second project in the collection focuses on the daily lives and culture of Arabic-speaking Americans in New York State and how they define their identity in American contexts.</p>
         <p>Rosenthal is also known for his work in Nicaragua, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Vietnam. He was one of the founders of the Triage Project (a collective of photographers, doctors and writers documenting homelessness and the health care crisis in New York City) and of Impact Visuals, a collective photography agency.</p>
         <p>Rosenthal is Distinguished Professor of Art at SUNY/Empire State College, where he teaches photography and directs the college's photography program in New York City. He is also the photography editor of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">culturefront</title>, the magazine of the New York Council for the Humanities, and has been awarded fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of 80 black-and-white photographic prints stemming from two projects undertaken by documentary photographer Mel Rosenthal. The first documents the destruction by arson of an entire South Bronx neighborhood in New York in the 1970s, where Rosenthal once lived, with images of burned-out buildings and neighborhood residents.  This work was published in book form as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">In the South Bronx of America</title> in 2001.  The second project depicts the culture and daily life of Arab Americans living in New York State, including men, women and children of Syrian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Algerian, Jordanian and Palestinian descent.  These images were taken in the 1990s and early 2000s, and portray family groups, businesses, wedding celebrations, classrooms, protests against violence following the attack on the World Trade Centers, 9/11, and the religious rituals of Christians, Muslims, Greek Orthodox, Maronites, Jews and Coptics. Some of these were published in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A community of many worlds: Arab American life in NYC</title>, 2002.</p>
         <p>Most of the matted gelatin silver prints measure 11x14 and 16x20 inches, with some larger prints measuring 20x24.  The two projects were also featured in separate exhibits at Duke University, which are accessible online.  Also included are a few publicity items and an audiocassette recording of Rosenthal speaking at an exhibit opening in 2004.  Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>
         <p>Also included are several publicity items for a workshop on documentary photography and select exhibitions, and an audiocassette recording of Rosenthal speaking at an exhibit opening in 2004.</p>

               <p>Comprises 33 matted black-and-white prints documenting the destruction in South Bronx neighborhoods by fire from 1975 to 1983.

Most of the gelatin silver prints measure 16x20 inches (mat size), but there are two larger prints measuring 20x24 inches.  Original titles and narrative comments by the photographer have been retained; titles supplied by library staff are in brackets.</p>

The decals would portray neat drapery, flowerpots, and window boxes, intimations of comfortable and happy domestic scenes. That way, commuters who passed through the Bronx en route to Westchester, Long Island, or the Connecticut executive belt wouldn't have to be upset by the sight of the misery that lines their way.</title> --Marshall Berman. <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Roots, Ruins, Renewals: City Life After Urbicide,</title>

You don't have to worry about spiraling rents, lack of space, congested streets, parking shortages, and a host of other problems that plague expanding businesses elsewhere. The Bronx has prime real estate that is affordable. No inflated prices like Westchester, New Jersey, or Long Island. The City of New York is planning to sell prime parcels of real estate for retail, light manufacturing, office and industrial development. These are properties which the city has held from sale until the market was right. Now the market is right.

                  <p>I showed the Rabbi a letter of introduction from the Museum of the City of New York which said  that they had commissioned me to photograph for them an exhibition about Arab American life in New York. They told me that I was in the wrong place because they were not Arabs.  They insisted that they were Sephardic and should be called that.  I pointed out to them that they spoke Arabic and were from a country which spoke Arabic and therefore could be considered Arabs. They weren't convinced, but it turned out that they did not have the tenth Jewish man that makes a ritual possible in the Jewish religion and there I was, the tenth man. So I got to celebrate Chanukah and to photograph them also.  Later because so many people took umbrage to being called an Arab I changed the letter to say that I was photographing Arabic speaking people and thus avoided problems. As with the case of many of the Christian Arabic speaking people, many seem to equate "Arab" with being Muslim and they did not want to be associated with that identification. September 11th made that even more pronounced.</p>

                  <p>The Church in Park Slope is a Greek-Melkite Catholic Church and the icon is St. Theodora. The people at the Church when I spoke to them about why I was photographing there they like the told me that they were not Arabs and were annoyed that I called them that. I asked them what they called themselves and they said they were Phoenicians. Having learned from the Moroccans, I said it was fine, and that this was a project about Arabic speaking people. I looked up Phoenicia in an Encyclopedia and they had a drawing of where Phoenicia had been and it was what now is Syria and Lebanon.</p>

                  <p>Widdi's is known throughout the Arab American community as the place to have your party after Ramadan, your wedding, your confirmation party, your fund raising party, or your political meeting of the community. Gold coins are traditional wedding presents which are pinned to the bride's dress at the marriage ceremony. It is common for the women to wear strings of gold coins minted in the Mid-East around their heads and their waists on special occasions such as this wedding. One man when I asked about it said that <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">we don't trust banks.</title>

                  <p>Debbie Almontaser, an educator and activist, carried a photograph of her son wherever she went. He was in the National Guard patrolling the area around Ground Zero and couldn't go to the Peace Vigil, September 16, 2001. After September 11th a number of people in Brooklyn Heights called her names and tried to get her to take off her hijab. She started to carry the photograph of her son who had been called up to the National Guard on September 11th. She told the people that were harassing her that he was in the National Guard patrolling the area around Ground Zero and that she was as patriotic as they were. She told me that the harassment was so bad that teachers at the public school where she worked had to escort her to school and back. Shortly after, she resigned from teaching there.</p>
